Paper: To comment or not? A data-driven look at attitudes toward code comments

Introduction
Every programmer has asked themselves “how many comments are too many?” To the newest programmers, comments may seem magical--a way of documenting without giving instructions to the computer. But commenting engages the same vulnerability as more advanced challenges (i.e. pair programming & code review) and is likely to pique the insecurity of many programmers (especially the copy-and-paste or tutorial-level programmer)!

While most of us agree that commenting is part of writing maintainable code, it’s very difficult for someone who has not yet worked in a community-reviewed codebase to know what is good practice and not. The answers that come back often conflict each other: Code should be DRY, but well-placed comments save future devs. How can someone find the commenting style that is best for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? My survey of 170 long-time developers, Computer Science majors, bootcamp grads, & hobby programmers confirms some expectations and brings others into question. Join me for a data-based chat about the biggest pain points caused by our attitudes toward commenting and the steps we can take to encourage a growth mindset and empower programmers of all levels.

Background


Methods
Data Collection & Analysis 
Survey respondents were recruited from online posts on developer-oriented Facebook groups, Twitter, geographic and interest-based developer Slacks. The author also asked audiences to participate in her survey when speaking on other topics at conferences. 

My questions are below:
 * Short answer:
  * Current/recent use: Comment uncertainty, Function-level comments, Clarification, Unused code, Other
  * When comments added: Scoping & planning, As functions written, Pairing, As I learn people don’t understand, Clean-up
  * How long programming?
  * How long professionally?
  * Path to programming?
 * Agree/Disagree:
  * Comments:
   * Help me remember what my code does
   * Clarify my thinking
   * Help me learn
   * Save time
   * Delete before projects is shared
  * Uncomfortable writing
  * Yes to function-level, no in-line
  * Clear code is self-documenting
* Participants were recruited from forums that cater to individuals at a variety of skill levels without any introduction on the questions being tested
130 people participated as of 2/15/2019 and this number continues to increase.
