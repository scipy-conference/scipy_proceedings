Hello {{ reviewer }}!

The 2017 Scientific Computing with Python Conference
(http://scipy2017.scipy.org) is fast approaching, and so too is the deadline
for proceedings submissions (May 16th) and consequently the start of the
review process.

We welcome you to be a member of the Proceedings Review Committee this year.
This should require a little of your time spread out over the review period
(May 16th to July 4th) to evaluate three assigned submissions aligned with your
areas of expertise.

In the spirit of open source software, the SciPy conference uses a fully open
and collaborative review process to make proceedings acceptance decisions.
To learn more about this, you can read about it on the proceedings github page,
https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings.

Please let us know if you wish to participate this year and we will include
you in subsequent communications.  Also, please don't hesitate to connect us
with any other community members who you think we should consider inviting to
review.

Yours Truly,
Your SciPy 2017 Proceedings co-chairs,
Scott Rostrup and Sebastian Benthall
