Subject:  [|conference| |year|] invitation to review proceedings

Dear colleague and friend,

Considering your expertise, we would like to invite you to review the two
attached articles for the |conference| |year| conference proceedings. Everyone who
presented at this year's conference was invited to submit an article for
consideration in the peer-reviewed proceedings. The conference presentations
were selected by a program committee, based on submitted abstracts and the
follow criteria:  applicability, novelty, and general impression.  Each
abstract was reviewed by at least four reviewers. Of the |abstracts| accepted
abstracts, we have |papers| submitted papers to review.

We would appreciate it if, within the next three days, you could confirm
whether or not you'll be able to take part in this process.  Reviews are due by
|due| and should be submitted via email to |emails|.

The purpose of the conference proceedings is to increase the visibility of the
conference and the presented work, as well as to provide academic recognition
of the significant contributions made by the developers of software for science
and engineering. To ensure the published proceedings are of sufficiently high
quality, we have have instituted a formal review process in which each paper
will be reviewed by at least two reviewers according to explicit and uniform
criteria.

The primary goal of the review process is to provide independent feedback that
guide authors in improving their papers. To review a paper, please complete the
attached review form.

Please note that, while reviewers' recommendations regarding a paper's
suitability for publication are seriously considered, the final decision rests
with the proceeding editors.

Of course, you are more than welcome (and encouraged!) to review additional
papers, if time and interest permits.  You can browse the submitted papers

Please note that all reviews are made public including the reviewer's name.
