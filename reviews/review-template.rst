INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Please read the submitted article and fully complete this form. Since we don't
have a copy editor, we also request that you annotate the PDF [1]_ to highlight
typos, formatting issues, and grammatical mistakes.

The goal of the review process is two-fold.  First, it guides authors in
improving their papers and, secondly, ensures that published works are of a
professional academic standard.

Research in science and engineering increasingly relies on software for
data processing and management as well as theoretical exploration.  However,
the effort necessary to develop this software is rarely recognized as having
the same academic worth as other aspects of the research. These proceedings
are, at least in part, intended to address this shortcoming.

An article focused on software development necessarily differs from the
standard scientific article with respect to format. For instance, it is
unlikely to have the same sections (i.e., introduction, methods, results,
conclusion). You may therefore have to rely on other factors to decide whether
the paper sets a high enough standards as an academic publication.

Please note that, while reviewers' recommendations regarding a paper's
suitability for publication are seriously considered, the final decision rests
with the proceeding editors.

SPECIFIC EVALUATION
-------------------

For the following questions, please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.  If you
answer 'no',  please provide a brief, one- to two-sentence explanation.

- Is the code made publicly available and does the article sufficiently
  describe how to access it?  We aim not to publish papers that essentially
  advertise propetiary software.  Therefore, if the code is not publicly
  available, please provide a one- to two- sentence response to each of the
  following questions:

  - Does the article focus on a topic other than the features
    of the software itself?
  - Can the majority of statements made be externally validated
    (i.e., without the use of the software)?
  - Is the information presented of interest to readers other than
    those at whom the software is aimed?
  - Is there any other aspect of the article that would
    justify including it despite the fact that the code
    isn't available?
  - Does the article discuss the reasons the software is closed?

- Does the article present the problem in an appropriate context?
  Specifically, does it:

  - explain why the problem is important,
  - describe in which situations it arises,
  - outline relevant previous work,
  - provide background information for non-experts

- Is the content of the paper accessible to a computational scientist
  with no specific knowledge in the given field?

- Does the paper describe a well-formulated scientific or technical
  achievement?

- Are the technical and scientific decisions well-motivated and
  clearly explained?

- Are the code examples (if any) sound, clear, and well-written?

- Is the paper factual correct?

- Is the language and grammar of sufficient quality?

- Are the conclusions justified?

- Is prior work properly and fully cited?

- Should any part of the article be shortened or expanded? Please explain.

- In your view, is the paper fit for publication in the conference proceedings?
  Please suggest specific improvements and indicate whether you think the
  article needs a significant rewrite (rather than a minor revision).
