Dear Most Awesome SciPy Volunteer,

Thank you for responding to the SciPy 2024 Program Review Committee Interest Form. The results of that form indicate that you are willing to complete full paper reviews for the SciPy Proceedings.

We appreciate your interest and extend this invitation to you to become a SciPy 2024 Proceedings reviewer. We hope to hear an acceptance from you via a reply to this email (reply-to: proceedings@scipy.org) by April 23, 2024.

This will be an exciting year for the SciPy Proceedings. Starting this year, the SciPy Proceedings will be hosted by a professional journal publication platform, Curvenote, a Gold sponsor of SciPy 2024 (see the announcement at https://curvenote.com/news/curvenote-sponsors-scipy-proceedings-2024). Curvenote is a leader for the development of MyST Markdown (https://mystmd.org/), the next-generation Python markdown embraced by Sphinx and Jupyter for embedding interactive code into scientific publications. Curvenote will significantly improve the look and feel of SciPy Proceedings as well as position SciPy Proceedings at the forefront of scientific publication along with other Curvenote journal publishers such as the American Geophysical Union, Microscopy Society of America, and Physiome.

If you accept, the process for reviewing papers will be introduced to you through both written instructions and optional webinars. The Proceedings Committee aims to make this process easy and lightweight for you. In a nutshell, 1) you will preview rendered papers on the Curvenote SciPy Proceedings website (see the 2023 preview at https://proceedings.scipy.org/), and 2) you will make review comments on source code (either MyST or LaTeX) for the papers through the normal GitHub pull request review process. Knowledge of MyST or LaTeX is not required on the part of the reviewer. Your job as a reviewer will be to make helpful and friendly comments on the content and style of rendered papers in order to produce the best possible SciPy Proceedings.

Should you accept, you will be assigned a paper to review according to the schedule below based on two factors: 1) the tracks you indicated you would be willing to review on the SciPy 2024 Program Review Committee Interest Form, and 2) the conflict of interest information you have already provided to the program committee, both of which have been shared with the proceedings committee. The proceedings committee anticipates you will use the GitHub userid you also provided on the interest form for your review work.

The 2024 schedule for the SciPy Proceedings is based around an initial review, a final review, and a final decision. Within the schedule are dates pertaining to three roles: authors, reviewers, and editors.
