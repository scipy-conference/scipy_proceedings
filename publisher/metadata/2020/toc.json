        "Jupyter has become the go-to platform for developing data applications but data\nand security concerns, especially when dealing with healthcare, have become\nparamount for many institutions and applications dealing with sensitive\ninformation. How then can we continue to enjoy the data analysis and machine\nlearning opportunities provided by Jupyter and the Python ecosystem while\nguaranteeing auditable compliance with security and privacy concerns?  We will\ndescribe the architecture and implementation of a cloud based platform based on\nJupyter that integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and uses containerized\nservices without exposing the platform to the vulnerabilities present in\nKubernetes and JupyterHub. This architecture addresses the HIPAA requirements\nto ensure both security and privacy of data. The architecture uses an AWS\nservice to provide JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication as well as network\ncontrol. Furthermore, our architecture enables secure collaboration and sharing\nof Jupyter notebooks. Even though our platform is focused on Jupyter notebooks\nand JupyterLab, it also supports R-Studio and bespoke applications that share\nthe same authentication mechanisms. Further, the platform can be extended to\nother cloud services other than AWS."

        "Most machine learning models, especially artificial neural networks, require numerical, not categorical data. We briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of common encoding schemes. For example, one-hot encoding is commonly used for attributes with a few unrelated categories and word embeddings for attributes with many related categories (e.g., words). Neither is suitable for encoding attributes with many unrelated categories, such as diagnosis codes in healthcare applications. Application of one-hot encoding for diagnosis codes, for example, can result in extremely high dimensionality with low sample size problems or artificially induce machine learning artifacts, not to mention the explosion of computing resources needed. Quasi-orthonormal encoding (QOE) fills the gap. We briefly show how QOE compares to one-hot encoding. We provide example code of how to implement QOE using popular ML libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch and a demonstration of QOE to MNIST handwriting samples."

        "The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is an X-ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL) facility enabling scientists to take snapshots of single macromolecules to study their structure and dynamics. A major LCLS upgrade, LCLS-II, will bring the repetition rate of the X-ray source from 120 to 1 million pulses per second and exascale High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities will be required for the data analysis to keep up with the future data taking rates.",
        "We present here a Python application for Fluctuation X-ray Scattering (FXS), an emerging technique for analyzing biomolecular structure from the angular correlations of FEL diffraction snapshots with one or more particles in the beam. This FXS application for experimental data analysis is being developed to run on supercomputers in near real-time while an experiment is taking place.",

        "HOOMD-blue is a library for running molecular dynamics and hard particle Monte Carlo simulations\nthat uses pybind11 to provide a Python interface to fast C++ internals. The package is designed\nto scale from a single CPU core to thousands of NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. In developing HOOMD-blue\nversion 3.0, we significantly improve the application protocol interface (API) by making it more\nflexible, extensible, and Pythonic. We have also striven to provide simpler and more performant\nentry points to the internal C++ classes and data structures. With these updates, we show how\nHOOMD-blue users will be able to write completely custom Python classes which integrate directly\ninto the simulation run loop and analyze previously inaccessible data.\nThroughout this paper, we focus on how these goals have been achieved and explain design\ndecisions through examples of the newly developed API."

        "There is a growing interest in leveraging differential geometry in the machine learning community. Yet, the adoption of the associated geometric computations has been inhibited by the lack of a reference implementation. Such an implementation should typically allow its users: (i) to get intuition on concepts from differential geometry through a hands-on approach, often not provided by traditional textbooks; and (ii) to run geometric machine learning algorithms seamlessly, without delving into the mathematical details. To address this gap, we present the open-source Python package geomstats and introduce hands-on tutorials for differential geometry and geometric machine learning algorithms - Geometric Learning - that rely on it. Code and documentation: github.com/geomstats/geomstats and geomstats.ai."

        "Pyvis is a Python module that enables visualizing and interactively manipulating network graphs in the Jupyter notebook, or as a standalone web application. Pyvis is built on top of the powerful and mature VisJS JavaScript library, which allows for fast and responsive interactions while also abstracting away the low-level JavaScript and HTML. This means that elements of the rendered graph visualization, such as node/edge attributes can be specified within Python and shipped to the JavaScript layer for VisJS to render. This declarative approach makes it easy to quickly explore graph visualizations and investigate data relationships. In addition, Pyvis is highly customizable so that colors, sizes, and hover tooltips can be assigned to the rendered graph. The network graph layout is controlled by a front-end physics engine that is configurable from a Python interface, allowing for the detailed placement of the graph elements. In this paper, we outline use cases for Pyvis with specific examples to highlight key features for any analysis workflow. A brief overview of Pyvis' implementation describes how the Python front-end binding uses simple Pyvis calls."

        "Ubiquitous data poses challenges on current machine learning systems to store, handle and analyze data at scale.\nTraditionally, this task is tackled by dividing the data into (large) batches. Models are trained on a data batch\nand then used to obtain predictions.  As new data becomes available, new models are created which may contain\nprevious data or not. This training-testing cycle is repeated continuously. Stream learning is an active field where\nthe goal is to learn from infinite data streams. This gives rise to additional challenges to those found in the\ntraditional batch setting: First, data is not stored (it is infinite), thus models are exposed only once to single\nsamples of the data, and once processed those samples are not seen again. Models shall be ready to provide\npredictions at any time. Compute resources such as memory and time are limited, consequently, they shall be carefully\nmanaged. The data can drift over time and models shall be able to adapt accordingly.\nThis is a key difference with respect to batch learning, where data is assumed static and models will fail in the\npresence of change. Model degradation is a side-effect of batch learning in many real-world applications requiring\nadditional efforts to address it. This papers provides a brief overview of the core concepts of machine learning for\ndata streams and describes scikit-multiflow, an open-source Python library specifically created for machine\nlearning on data streams. scikit-multiflow is built to serve two main purposes: easy to design and run\nexperiments, easy to extend and modify existing methods."

        "Perturbations of organellar structures within a cell are useful indicators of the cell’s response to viral or bacterial invaders. Of the various organelles, mitochondria are meaningful to model because they show distinct migration patterns in the presence of potentially fatal infections, such as tuberculosis. Properly modeling and assessing mitochondria could provide new information about infections that can be leveraged to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines. Traditionally, mitochondrial structures have been assessed via manual inspection of fluorescent microscopy imagery.  However, manual microscopy studies are labor-intensive and fail to provide a high-throughput for screenings. Thus, demonstrating the need for techniques that are more automated and utilize quantitative metrics for analysis. Yet, modeling mitochondria is no trivial task; mitochondria are amorphous, spatially diffuse structures that render traditional shape-based, parametric modeling techniques ineffective. We address the modeling task by using OrNet (Organellar Networks), a Python framework that utilizes probabilistic, graph-theoretic techniques to cast mitochondrial dynamics in the mold of dynamic social networks. We propose quantitative temporal and spatial anomaly detection techniques that leverage the graph connectivity information of the social networks to reveal time points of anomalous behavior and spatial regions where organellar structures undergo significant morphological changes related to a relevant change in environment or stimulus. We demonstrate the advantages of these techniques with the results of exhaustive graph-theoretic analyses over time in three different mitochondrial conditions. This methodology provides the quantification, visualization, and analysis techniques necessary for rigorous spatiotemporal modeling of diffuse organelles."

        "The focus of this paper is the bit error probability (BEP) performance\ndegradation when the transmit and receive pulse shaping filters are\nmismatched. The modulation schemes considered are MPSK and MQAM.\nIn the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel both spectral\nefficiency and noise mitigation is commonly achieved by using\nsquare-root raised cosine (SRC) pulse shaping at both the transmitter\nand receiver. The novelty of this paper primarily lies in the use\nsemi-analytic BEP simulation for conditional error probability calculations,\nwith transmit and receive filter mismatch, the optional inclusion of a small FIR equalizer.\nFor lower order MPSK and MQAM, i.e., 8PSK and 16QAM  power degradation at\n is 0.1 dB when the excess bandwidth mismatch tx/rx = 0.25/0.35 or 0.35/0.25,\nbut quickly grows as the modulation order increases and/or the mismatch increases."

        "Micro-core architectures combine many simple, low memory, low power computing cores together in a single package. These can be used as a co-processor or standalone but due to limited on-chip memory and esoteric nature of the hardware, writing efficient parallel codes for these chips is challenging. In this paper we discuss our very low memory implementation of Python, ePython, supporting the rapid development of parallel Python codes for these co-processors. An offload abstraction is introduced, where programmers decorate specific functions in their Python code, running under any Python interpreter on the host CPU, with the underlying technology then taking care of the low level data movement, scheduling and ePython execution on the micro-core co-processor. A benchmark solving Laplace's equation for diffusion via Jacobi iteration is used to explore the performance of ePython on three different micro-core architectures, and introduces work around native compilation for micro-cores and the performance advantages that this can provide."

        "A framework for combining physics-based and data-driven models to improve well construction is presented in this study. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a more robust and accurate model that mitigates the disadvantages of using purely physics-based or data-driven models. This approach can provide improved model-based control of drilling rig actuators (assocated with mud pumps, pipe handling systems, etc.).",
        "Traditionally, models based on physics including Hagen-Poiseuille flow, Hooke’s law, etc. are used during well construction. Physics-based models facilitate the design of the drilling plan and are vital to safely and successfully drilling wellbores. There are two major shortcomings, however, to using purely physics-based models. First, the models can be inaccurate if the physical dynamics are not fully accounted for. Accurately capturing data to describe these processes can be involved, complex or prohibitively expensive. Second, these models must be maintained and calibrated during drilling, which requires a large amount of operator input and is liable to human error. On the other hand, pure data-driven approaches are unable to represent underlying mechanism dynamics and often struggle to properly capture causal relationships. It is shown in this work combining physics and data-driven modeling provides a more robust framework for well planning and execution.",
        "Machine learning techniques are combined with physics-based models via a rule-based stochastic hidden Markov model, using the modeling of frictional pressure losses during fluid circulation in the well as an example. Gaussian processes, neural networks and a deep learning model are trained and executed together with a physics model that is directly derived using first principles.",
        "The results show that combination modeling can accurately predict the pressure losses even outperforming the physics-based and purely data-driven modeling. The proposed approach has a good potential to allow safer, optimized well construction operations."

        "As the scale of science projects increase, so does the demand on computing\ninfrastructures. The complexity of science processing pipelines, and the\nheterogeneity of the environments on which they are run, continues to increase;\nin order to deal with this, the algorithmic approaches to executing these\napplications must also be adapted and improved to deal with this increased\ncomplexity. An example of this is workflow scheduling, algorithms for which are\ncontinually being developed; however, in many systems that are used to deploy\nscience workflows for major science projects, the same algorithms and\nheuristics are used for scheduling. We have developed SHADOW, a workflow-oriented\nscheduling algorithm framework built to address an absence of open\nimplementations of these common algorithms, and to facilitate the development\nand testing of new algorithms against these 'industry standards'. SHADOW has\nimplementations of common scheduling heuristics, with the intention of\ncontinually updating the framework with heuristics, metaheuristics, and\nmathematical optimisation approaches in the near future. In addition to the\nalgorithm implementations, there is also a number of workflow and environment\ngeneration options, using the companion utility SHADOWGen; this has been\nprovided to improve the productivity of algorithm developers in experimenting\nwith their new algorithms over a large variety of workflows and computing\nenvironments. SHADOWGen also has a translation utilities that will convert from\nother formats, like the Pegasus DAX file, into the SHADOW-JSON configuration.\nSHADOW is open-source and uses key SciPy libraries; the intention is for the\nframework to become a reference implementation of scheduling algorithms, and\nprovide algorithm designers an opportunity to develop and test their own\nalgorithms with  the framework. SHADOW code is hosted on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/myxie/shadow; documentation for the project is available in\nthe repository, as well as at https://shadowscheduling.readthedocs.org."

        "Where traditional example-based tests check software using manually-specified\ninput-output pairs, property-based tests exploit a general description of\nvalid inputs and program behaviour to automatically search for falsifying\nexamples.  Given that Python has excellent property-based testing tools,\nsuch tests are often easier to work with and routinely find serious bugs\nthat all other techniques have missed.",
        "I present four categories of properties relevant to most scientific projects,\ndemonstrate how each found real bugs in Numpy and Astropy, and propose that\nproperty-based testing should be adopted more widely across the SciPy ecosystem."

        "Motile cilia are a highly conserved organelle found on the exterior of many human cells.\nCilia beat in rhythmic patterns to transport substances or generate signaling gradients.\nDisruption of these patterns is often indicative of diseases known as ciliopathies, whose\nconsequences can include dysfunction of macroscopic structures within the lungs, kidneys,\nbrain, and other organs. Characterizing ciliary motion phenotypes as healthy or diseased\nis an essential step towards diagnosing and differentiating ciliopathies. We propose a\nmodular generative pipeline for the analysis of cilia video data so that expert labor may\nbe supplemented for this task. Our proposed model is divided into three modules:\npreprocessing, appearance, and dynamics. The preprocessing module augments the initial data,\nand its output is fed frame-by-frame into the generative appearance model which learns a\ncompressed latent representation of the cilia. The frames are then embedded into the latent\nspace as a low-dimensional path. This path is fed into the generative dynamics module,\nwhich focuses only on the motion of the cilia. Since both the appearance and dynamics modules\nare generative, the pipeline itself serves as an end-to-end generative model. This thorough\nand versatile model allows experts to spend less time caught in the minutiae of cilia biopsy\nanalysis, while also enabling new insights by quantifying subtle patterns that would be\notherwise difficult to categorize."
