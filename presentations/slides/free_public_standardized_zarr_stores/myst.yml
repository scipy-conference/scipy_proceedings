  abstract: At the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC), we're doing the heavy lifting to make large geospatial datasets easily accessible from the cloud. No more downloading data. No more worrying about quirky metadata or missing dimensions. No more concatenating hundreds or thousands of files together. Just fire up your Jupyter notebook somewhere in Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s US-West-2 region, get some free temporary AWS credentials, open our Zarr stores, and start doing your science.
