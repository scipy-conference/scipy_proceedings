  abstract: A presentation about scikit-build-core exploring how it modernizes Python extension building by integrating CMake with Python packaging standards, enabling seamless cross-compilation and multi-platform support. The slides highlight key features such as simplified configuration, support for multiple languages like C++, Fortran, and Cython, and the transition from the classic scikit-build. They also provide insights into how scikit-build-core enhances the development experience and streamlines Python module creation for diverse environments.
