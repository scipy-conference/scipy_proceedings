    "description": "Cyber defense, and in particular threat detection, requires gaining insight from very large amounts of telemetry data, using unsupervised learning. This talk presents a method for embedding such data in vector spaces and exploring it through interactive visualization and labeling, using _data maps_. We demonstrate this method by looking at the baseline behaviours of hosts in the open ACME3 dataset of host-based telemetry.",
