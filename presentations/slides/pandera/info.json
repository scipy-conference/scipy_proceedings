    "description": "This talk is about how Pandera has evolved to provide a standard schema interface for easily extending and supporting validation backends for arbitrary statistical data containers. Attendees will learn not only about data testing principles such as run-time validation and property-based testing, they will also learn about the challenges of maintaining and evolving an open source project that many people rely on as a critical piece of their data infrastructure. The high-level goal for this talk is to highlight lessons learned from Pandera’s particular journey from supporting only Pandas as a backend to supporting a whole suite of data objects.",
