  abstract: Until recently, SciPyâ€™s best options for scalar quadrature, minimization, and root finding called compiled code, which could not take advantage of a vectorized Python integrand, objective function, or residual function; SciPy offered no functions for accurate numerical differentiation or series summation. These gaps are being filled with a family of pure-Python, array API compatible functions for dramatically faster vectorized calculation of scalar integrals, infinite sums, derivatives, minimizers, and roots.
