  abstract: We present Aeromancy, an opinionated philosophy and open-sourced framework that closely tracks experimental runtime environments for more reproducible machine learning. In existing experiment trackers, itâ€™s easy to miss important details about how an experiment was run, e.g., which version of a dataset was used as input or the exact versions of library dependencies. Missing these details can make replicability more difficult. Aeromancy aims to make this process smoother by providing both new infrastructure (a more comprehensive versioning scheme including both system runtimes and external datasets) and a corresponding set of best practices to ensure experiments are maximally trackable.
