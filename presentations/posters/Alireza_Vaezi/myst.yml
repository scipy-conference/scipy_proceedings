  abstract: Understanding cilia behavior is essential in diagnosing and treating such diseases. But, the tasks of automatically analysing cilia are often a labor and time-intensive since there is a lack of automated segmentation. In this work we overcome this bottleneck by developing a robust, self-supervised framework exploiting the visual similarity of normal and dysfunctional cilia. This framework generates pseudolabels from optical flow motion vectors, which serve as training data for a semi-supervised neural network. Our approach eliminates the need for manual annotations, enabling accurate and efficient segmentation of both motile and immotile cilia.
