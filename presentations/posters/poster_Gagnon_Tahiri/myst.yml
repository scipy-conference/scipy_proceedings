  abstract: Cumacea crustaceans serve as vital indicators of benthic health in marine ecosystems. This study investigates the influence of environmental parameters on their genetic makeup in the North Atlantic, focusing on Icelandic waters. We analyze mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene sequences from 62 Cumacea specimens collected across varying depths.
