  abstract: Hi! Have you ever wished your pure Python libraries were faster? Or wanted to fundamentally improve a Python library by rewriting everything in a faster language like C or Rust? Well, wish no more... NetworkX's backend dispatching mechanism redirects your plain old NetworkX function calls to a FASTER implementation present in a separate backend package by leveraging Python's `entry_point` specification! NetworkX is a popular, pure Python library used for graph (aka network) analysis. But when the graph size increases (like a network of everyone in the world), NetworkX algorithms could take days to solve a simple graph analysis problem. To address these performance issues, this backend dispatching mechanism was recently developed. This poster explores NetworkX's parallel backend that utilizes Joblib to run graph algorithms on multiple CPU cores and how we can use it just by specifying a `backend` keyword argument or by passing the backend graph object (type-based dispatching). It also goes over some of the future ToDos for the nx-parallel backend, the speedups obtained, and some important notes to ponder about. Last but not at all the least, it depicts the ideal pipeline starting from networkx, going on to nx-parallel, then to joblib, and then towards the various parallel libraries. (nx-parallel GitHub repo - https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel) Thank you :)
