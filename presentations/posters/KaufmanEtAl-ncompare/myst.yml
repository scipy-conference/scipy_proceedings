  abstract: As netCDF (Network Common Data Form) files are widely used in Earth science — with climate models, oceanographic or atmospheric reanalyses, and observational data — improved means of evaluating netCDF files can help enable a wide range of applications. We have developed a reusable open source approach through `ncompare`, which is a Python package for comparing netCDF structures. `ncompare` facilitates rapid comparisons by generating a formatted display of the matching and non-matching groups, variables, and associated metadata between two NetCDF datasets. The user has the option to colorize the terminal output for ease of viewing, and `ncompare` can optionally save comparison reports in text, comma-separated value (CSV), and/or Microsoft Excel formats.
