  "description": "This poster explores the use of Generative AI models for time series analysis and forecasting, specifically in the context of energy consumption. It compares traditional statistical methods, such as ARIMA, with advanced AI-based techniques like AutoGluon-TimeSeries, xLSTM, and TimeGPT. The study aims to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these methods using real-world energy data from the PJM Interconnection LLC. Results indicate that AI-based models, particularly xLSTM and AutoGluon-TimeSeries, outperform traditional models in forecasting accuracy, showcasing their potential for better resource management and decision-making in climate change mitigation."
