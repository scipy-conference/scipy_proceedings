# Style Guide for SciPy Conference Proceedings

Please refer to this guide along with the current [README](https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings/blob/2024/README.md) of the repository for the proceedings.

There is a page limit of 8 pages on the paper, excluding references.

For general Style Guide details please check [IEEE style guide](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/style_references_manual.pdf). For inclusive language, please refer to [American Psychological Association’s style guide](https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines). This style guide is based on both these references. Use [Strunk and White 4th edition](https://archive.org/details/TheElementsOfStyle4thEdition) as a grammar reference. We use [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) as the English dictionary.


### Paper Title

In the paper title, capitalize the first letter of the first and last word and all the nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions (If, Because, That, Which). Capitalize abbreviations that are otherwise lowercase (e.g., use DC, not dc or Dc) except for unit abbreviations and acronyms. Articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for, or, nor), and most short prepositions are lowercase unless they are the first or last word. Prepositions of more than three letters (Before, Through, With, Without, Versus, Among, Under, Between) should be capitalized.


### Body of a Paper

The body of a paper should contain the following sections; not every paper will have each of these sections.


#### Abstract

Every published paper must contain an Abstract. Abstracts shall not contain numbered mathematical equations or numbered references.

#### Appendix

Numbering should be (Appending I) or (Appendix A)


#### Acknowledgements

They should appear after the text of the paper, before references, after appendix. Do not use Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Miss (list first initial and last name only). Use the Dr. or Prof. title with each name separately; do not use plural Drs. or Profs. with lists of names.

The acknowledgement sections should be written in the third person.


#### Author Affiliations

Abbreviations should be written out in Affiliations (e.g. LANL should be written as Los Alamos National Lab).


#### References

Every reference should be a separate entry. Using one number for more than one reference is not allowed.


#### Text Citation of Figures and Tables

All citations of figures and tables in text must be in numerical order. Citations to figures in text always carry the abbreviation "Fig." followed by the figure number. The abbreviation is used even when it begins a sentence.



### Other Text


#### Footnotes

Footnotes should be numbered in consecutive order throughout the text. The footnote numbers are superscripts in text and in the actual footnotes. In text, place the superscript footnote numbers after the punctuation such as fullstops, commas, and parentheses, but before colons, dashes, quotation marks, and semicolons in a compound sentence. The footnotes should be placed at the bottom of the text column in which they are cited.


#### List in Text

The ordering of labeling for all lists is 1), 2), 3) followed by a), b), c), and then i), ii), iii).

For example, first list goes as this: 1) first item; 2) second item; and 3) third item.


#### Editorial style


##### Acronyms

Adding abbreviations to the metadata means we have accessible abbreviations across all instances of abbreviations in the manuscript. ([reference](https://mystmd.org/guide/glossaries-and-terms#abbreviations))

Define acronyms the first time they appear in the Abstract as well as the first time they appear in the body of the paper, written out as part of the sentence, followed by the acronym in parentheses. If the acronym is not repeated in the Abstract, do not include the acronym in parentheses. Coined plurals or plurals of acronyms do not take the apostrophe (e.g., FETs).

Possessive forms of the acronym do take the apostrophe (e.g., CPU’s speed). Indefinite articles are assigned to abbreviations to fit the sound of the first letter (e.g., an FCC regulation; a BRI).


##### Plurals

Plurals of units of measure usually do not take the "s". For example, the plural form of 3 mil is 3 mil, but 3 bits/s instead of 3 bit/s. Plural forms of calendar years do not take the apostrophe (e.g., 1990s). To avoid confusion, plural forms of variables in equations do take the apostrophe (e.g., x’s).


### Inclusive language

This section of the style guide is copied from the APA - [American Psychological Association’s style guide](https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines). Refer to that for more details.

Avoid using identity-first language while talking about disabilities, either a person is born with or they are imposed later. This is not applicable for chosen identities, e.g, educators, programmers, etc.

### General Language Suggestions

(Thanks to Chris Calloway and Renci for the following instructions.)

Shortest sentences are the best. Some ways to shorten the sentences and make those professional are as follows:



1. Avoid "which" and "that". For example, don’t use – "the model that we trained". Instead use – "we trained a model"
2. Avoid using pronouns like "I", "we", etc. For example, avoid "we trained the model"; instead use "the trained model …"
3. Avoid passive voice.
4. Avoid using questions, use statements instead. For example, avoid "which metrics would be useful for success"; instead use "the success metrics here are …"
5. Avoid words, verbs with emotions. For example, avoid "reflecting on; theme"; use "in short, or summarizing; topic"
