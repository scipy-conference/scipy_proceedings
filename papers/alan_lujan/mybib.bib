                  syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in
                  vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the
                  primary array programming library for the Python language. It
                  has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields
                  as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience,
                  biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance
                  and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an
                  important part of the software stack used in the discovery of
                  gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black
                  hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts
                  lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for
                  organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is
                  the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is
                  constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects,
                  targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed
                  their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to
                  its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts
                  as an interoperability layer between such array computation
                  libraries and, together with its application programming
                  interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the
                  next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either
                  usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine
                  learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact
                  compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming
                  style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and
                  is consistent with other popular scientific computing
                  libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware
                  accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the
                  principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how
                  they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that
                  every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the
                  full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and
                  pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime
                  enables them to work together to achieve compelling
                  performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual
                  subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several
                  common benchmarks.},
