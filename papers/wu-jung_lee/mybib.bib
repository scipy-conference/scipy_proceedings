	abstract = {High-frequency sonar systems deployed on a broad variety of ocean observing platforms are creating a deluge of water column sonar data at unprecedented speed from all corners of the ocean. Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, either across different sonar instruments or with other oceanographic datasets, holds the key to monitoring and understanding the response of marine organisms to the rapidly changing environments. In this paper we present echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing water column sonar data from diverse instrument sources following a community convention and utilizing the widely embraced netCDF data model to encode sonar data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays, echopype facilitates intuitive, user-friendly exploration and use of sonar data in an instrument-agnostic manner. Through leveraging existing open-source Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, echopype directly enables computational interoperability and scalability in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a conceptually unified implementation framework for expanding its support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new data analysis and visualization functionalities. We envision the continued development of echopype as a catalyst for making information derived from water column sonar data an integrated component of regional and global ocean observation strategies.},

	abstract = {Acoustic echo sounders designed to map and discriminate organisms in the water column have primarily been deployed on ships. Because of acoustic attenuation of higher frequencies used to detect and discriminate micronekton and nekton, this has effectively restricted the range of this information to the upper water column. In an effort to overcome these range limitations by reducing the distance between the transducer and the targets of interest, dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) split-beam echo sounders were integrated into a Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) 600 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), effectively doubling the range of quantitative acoustic data into the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m). Data from the first set of missions in a range of conditions revealed that the AUV provided a stable platform for the echo sounders and improved vertical and horizontal positional accuracy over echo sounders towed by ships. In comparison to hull-mounted echo sounders, elimination of ship noise and surface bubbles provided a 17- and 19-dBW decrease in the noise floor for the 38- and 120-kHz echo sounders, respectively, effectively increasing the sampling range by 30\%-40\%. The extended depth range also increased the resolution of the acoustic horizontal footprint from 37-40 to 0.6-3.7 m, enabling discrimination of individual targets at depth. Also developed here is novel onboard echo sounder data processing and autonomy to allow sampling not feasible in a surface ship or towed configuration. Taken together, these data demonstrate an effective new tool for examining the biology of animals in the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m) in ways previously only possible in the upper ocean.},

Active acoustic techniques involve producing sound and receiving signals from organisms and other water column sources, offering the benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution and, via integration into different platforms, the ability to make measurements spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales. As a consequence, a variety of questions concerning the ecology of pelagic systems lend themselves to active acoustics, ranging from organism-level investigations and physiological responses to the environment to ecosystem-level studies and climate. As technologies and data analysis methods have matured, the use of acoustics in ecological studies has grown rapidly. We explore the continued role of active acoustics in addressing questions concerning life in the ocean, highlight creative applications to key ecological themes ranging from physiology and behavior to biogeography and climate, and discuss emerging avenues where acoustics can help determine how pelagic ecosystems function.},

Matecho supports various formats, such as the international standard format for the exchange of fisheries acoustics raw and edited data. The procedure allows the semiautomatic cleaning of echogram data and the application of automatic data filters, i.e., transient noise, attenuated signal and impulsive noise removal and background noise reduction. Echo-integration processing is executed for each depth layer and integrates their characteristics per elementary sampling unit. Sound scattered layers are automatically detected by segmentation from the echo-integrated echogram, and shoals are extracted according to an iterative process of aggregation of filtered echogram echoes that allows, in both cases, the calculation of the ad hoc parameters describing morphological, spatial location and acoustic characteristics of sound scattered layers and shoals. Matecho is open-source software for researchers and provides end users with a user-friendly, free executable program.},

We analysed vertical distribution and diel vertical migration (DVM) of mesopelagic acoustic scattering layers (SLs) recorded at 38 kHz across oceanographic regimes encountered during the circumglobal Malaspina expedition. Mesopelagic SLs were observed in all areas covered, but vertical distributions and DVM patterns varied markedly. The distribution of mesopelagic backscatter was deepest in the southern Indian Ocean (weighted mean daytime depth: WMD 590 m) and shallowest at the oxygen minimum zone in the eastern Pacific (WMD 350 m). DVM was evident in all areas covered, on average {\textasciitilde}50\% of mesopelagic backscatter made daily excursions from mesopelagic depths to shallow waters. There were marked differences in migrating proportions between the regions, ranging from {\textasciitilde}20\% in the Indian Ocean to {\textasciitilde}90\% in the Eastern Pacific. Overall the data suggest strong spatial gradients in mesopelagic DVM patterns, with implied ecological and biogeochemical consequences. Our results suggest that parts of this spatial variability can be explained by horizontal patterns in physical-chemical properties of water masses, such as oxygen, temperature and turbidity.},

With near real-time data delivery via a common Cyberinfrastructure, the OOI instruments two contrasting ocean systems at three scales. The Regional Cabled Array instruments a tectonic plate and overlying ocean in the northeast Pacific, providing a permanent electro-optical cable connecting multiple seafloor nodes that provide high power and bandwidth to seafloor sensors and moorings with instrumented wire crawlers, all with speed-of-light interactive capabilities. Coastal arrays include the Pioneer Array, a relocatable system currently quantifying the New England shelf-break front, and the Endurance Array, a fixed system off Washington and Oregon with connections to the Regional Cabled Array. The Global Arrays host deep-ocean moorings and gliders to provide interdisciplinary measurements of the water column, mesoscale variability, and air-sea fluxes at critical high latitude locations. The OOI has unique aspects relevant to the international ocean observing community. The OOI uses common sensor types, verification protocols, and data formats across multiple platform types in diverse oceanographic regimes. OOI observing is sustained, with initial deployment in 2013 and 25 years of operation planned. The OOI is distributed among sites selected for scientific relevance based on community input and linked by important oceanographic processes. Scientific highlights include real-time observations of a submarine volcanic eruption, time-series observations of methane bubble plumes from Southern Hydrate Ridge off Oregon, observations of anomalous low-salinity pulses off Oregon, discovery of new mechanisms for intrusions of the Gulf Stream onto the shelf in the Middle Atlantic Bight, documentation of deep winter convection in the Irminger Sea, and observations of extreme surface forcing at the most southerly surface mooring in the world ocean.},

	abstract = {Multifrequency echosounder data can provide a broad understanding of the underwater environment in a noninvasive manner. The analysis of echosounder data is, hence, a topic of great importance for the marine ecosystem. Semantic segmentation, a deep learning-based analysis method predicting the class attribute of each acoustic intensity, has recently been in the spotlight of the fisheries and aquatic industry since its result can be used to estimate the abundance of marine organisms. However, a fundamental problem with current methods is the massive reliance on the availability of large amounts of annotated training data, which can only be acquired through expensive handcrafted annotation processes, making such approaches unrealistic in practice. As a solution to this challenge, we propose a novel approach, where we leverage a small amount of annotated data (supervised deep learning) and a large amount of readily available unannotated data (unsupervised learning), yielding a new data-efficient and accurate semisupervised semantic segmentation method, all embodied into a single end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network architecture. Our method is evaluated on representative data from a sandeel survey in the North Sea conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. The rigorous experiments validate that our method achieves comparable results utilizing only 40\% of the annotated data on which the supervised method is trained, by leveraging unannotated data.},

	abstract = {We present a method to automatically measure fish from images taken using a stereo-camera system installed in a large trawl (CamTrawl). Different visibility and fish density conditions were evaluated to establish accuracy and precision of image-based length estimates when compared with physical length measurements. The automated image-based length estimates compared well with the trawl catch values and were comparable with manual image processing in good visibility conditions. Greatest agreement with trawl catch occurred when fish were within 20∘ of fully lateral presentation to the cameras, and within 150 cm of the cameras. High turbidity caused substantial over- and underestimates of length composition, and a greater number of incompletely extracted fish outlines. Multiple estimates of individual fish lengths showed a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 3\% in good visibility conditions. The agreement between manual and automated fish measurement estimates was not correlated with fish length or range from the camera (r2=0–0.08). Implementation of these methods can result in a large increase in survey efficiency, given the effort required to process the trawl catch.},
