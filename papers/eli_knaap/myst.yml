  title: 'geosnap: The Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package'
  subtitle: Open Tools for Urban, Regional, and Neighborhood Science
  description: Understanding neighborhood context is critical for social science research, public policy analysis, and urban planning. We introduce geosnap, the Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package, a suite of tools for exploring, modeling, and visualizing the social context and spatial extent of neighborhoods and regions over time.
