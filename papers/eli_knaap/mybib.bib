  abstract = {In recent years, social marketing principles and techniques have featured at the heart of government proposals for improving health and tackling health inequalities. This, in part, has led to a shift in the type of information and intelligence needed to support service planning at all levels. In particular, there has been increasing interest in the use of commercial geodemographic classification systems. Despite the amount of activity and associated investment in this area, there is evidence of a real lack of understanding among users about the tools themselves, and the added value they are providing in the National Health Service. This paper describes some of the potential applications of geodemographic tools in the health sector, and explores issues for consideration when selecting or using a system. This paper also describes a potentially cost-effective and sustainable model for utilizing geodemographic tools as part of a regional insight function within the health service. {\copyright} 2008 The Royal Society for Public Health.},

  abstract = {Geodemographic classifications provide discrete indicators of the social, economic and demographic characteristics of people living within small geographic areas. They have hitherto been regarded as products, which are the final "best" outcome that can be achieved using available data and algorithms. However, reduction in computational cost, increased network bandwidths and increasingly accessible spatial data infrastructures have together created the potential for the creation of classifications in near real time within distributed online environments. Yet paramount to the creation of truly real time geodemographic classifications is the ability for software to process and efficiency cluster large multidimensional spatial databases within a timescale that is consistent with online user interaction. To this end, this article evaluates the computational efficiency of a number of clustering algorithms with a view to creating geodemographic classifications "on the fly" at a range of different geographic scales.},

This means, in particular, that clusters of States characterized by uniformly high levels of obesity rates, as it happens for instance in the US Southern macro-region, may suffer from a perverse `geographical lock-in' effect that calls for coordinated action across States to implement effective countervailing policies.},

To test our approaches, we created a geodemographic classification based on the United Kingdom Census 2011 for the county of Leicestershire and compared it to the official 2011 Output Area Classification. Our results show that the two deep neural networks are successful in creating classifications which are statistically similar to the official classification and demonstrate high cluster homogeneity.},

This phenomenon occurred despite population decline in major cities and the physical expansion of their suburbs over the same decades. Simultaneously, arguments for smart growth and redevelopment of decaying urban cores rose in tenor. What smart growth advocates did not consider, however, were the negative impacts of advocating for inner-area redevelopment. Limits to suburban growth can increase urban density but in tandem increase land and housing prices. Smart growth policies can create a loss of affordable housing and accelerate gentrification and displacement. In this chapter, we investigate the relationship between smart growth policies and gentrification. We then detail how a 21st century vision of smart growth can more equitably mitigate the consequences of gentrification.},

This small search space makes it suitable to implement it on a mobile device. We present a mobile implementation that also handles changes in the road network, like traffic jams, and that allows instantaneous routing without noticeable delay for the user. Also, an algorithm to calculate large distance tables is currently the fastest if based on contraction hierarchies. {\copyright} 2012 INFORMS.},

Although scholars frequently lament the inadequacies of the various existing definitions of ``neighborhood,'' we argue that previous strategies relying on nonoverlapping boundaries such as block groups and tracts are fundamentally flawed. The approach taken here instead builds on insights of the mental mapping literature, the social networks literature, the daily activities pattern literature, and the travel to crime literature to propose a new definition of neighborhoods: egohoods. These egohoods are conceptualized as waves washing across the surface of cities, as opposed to independent units with nonoverlapping boundaries. This approach is illustrated using crime data from nine cities: Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, St. Louis, and Tucson. The results show that measures aggregated to our egohoods explain more of the variation in crime across the social environment than do models with measures aggregated to block groups or tracts. The results also suggest that measuring inequality in egohoods provides dramatically stronger positive effects on crime rates than when using the nonoverlapping boundary approach, highlighting the important new insights that can be obtained by using our egohood approach.},

Using census data from three decades (1980--2010) in 294 metropolitan statistical areas, we use a statistical decomposition method to unpack the aggregate spatiotemporal income dynamic into its contributing components: stability, growth and polarisation, providing a new look at the economic fortunes of diverse neighbourhoods. We examine the relative strength of each component in driving the overall pattern, in addition to whether, how, and why these forces wax and wane across space and over time. Our results show that over the long run, growth is a dominant form of change across all metros, but there is a very clear decline in its prominence over time. Further, we find a growing positive relationship between the components of dispersion and growth, in a reversal of prior trends. Looking across metro areas, we find temporal heterogeneity has been driven by different socioeconomic factors over time (such as sectoral growth in certain decades), and that these relationships vary enormously with geography and time. Together these findings suggest a high level of temporal heterogeneity in neighbourhood income dynamics, a phenomenon which remains largely unexplored in the current literature. There is no universal law governing the changing economic status of neighbourhoods in the US over the last 40 years, and our work demonstrates the importance of considering shifting dynamics over multiple spatial and temporal scales.}

  abstract = {Racial residential segregation is a longstanding topic of focus across the disciplines of urban social science. Classically, segregation indices are calculated based on areal groupings (e.g., counties or census tracts), with more recent research exploring ways that spatial relationships can enter the equation. Spatial segregation measures embody the notion that proximity to one's neighbors is a better specification of residential segregation than simply who resides together inside the same arbitrarily drawn polygon. Thus, they expand the notion of ``who is nearby'' to include those who are geographically close to each polygon rather than a binary inside/outside distinction. Yet spatial segregation indices often resort to crude measurements of proximity, such as the Euclidean distance between observations, given the complexity and data requirements of calculating more theoretically appropriate measures, such as distance along the pedestrian travel network. In this paper, we examine the ramifications of such decisions. For each metropolitan region in the U.S., we compute both Euclidean and network-based spatial segregation indices. We use a novel inferential framework to examine the statistical significance of the difference between the two measures and following, we use features of the network topology (e.g., connectivity, circuity, throughput) to explain this difference using a series of regression models. We show that there is often a large difference between segregation indices when measured by these two strategies (which is frequently significant). Further, we explain which topology measures reduce the observed gap and discuss implications for urban planning and design paradigms.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood poverty experienced over time by low-income households is a topic of increasing interest and public policy importance. We employ sequence analysis of neighborhood poverty rates to identify distinct patterns among the 18- to 22-year longitudinal residential trajectories of 389 low-income households in the United States who formed households during 1988--1992, as represented in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Our most striking finding is the important role of poverty in their first neighborhood to the probability that low-income households ultimately reside in neighborhoods with higher poverty rates. Contrary to conventional wisdom, there are a wide variety of neighborhood poverty trajectories that low-income American households experience. However, those with felicitous neighborhood trajectories were almost entirely White households. The majority of Blacks formed households in high-poverty neighborhoods and were unlikely to live in any other sort of neighborhood for the next two decades when they are typically raising children.

T HE TERM "succession" seems to have first gained currency and definition as a result of its use in the writings of the plant ecolo-gists. It has not the same wide application in animal ecology, and where it has been used elsewhere, as it has by sociological writers, it seems to be a useful word but without as yet any very pre cise connotation. It has been used, for example, in describing the intra-mural movements and shiftings of population incident to the growth of the city and of its various "natural areas." It has been observed, for one thing, that immigrant peoples ordinarily settle first in or near the centers of cities, in the so-called areas of transition. From there they are likely to move by stages (perhaps one might better say, by leaps and bounds) from an area of first to areas of second and third settlement, generally in the direc-tion of the periphery of the city and eventually into the suburban area-in any case, from a less to a more stable section of the metro-politan region. To these movements, seeing in them the effects of natural tendencies in the life of the urban community, students have applied the term "succession."},

Burgess (1886-1966) developed a distinctive program of urban research in the sociology department at the University of Chicago. In numerous research projects focused on the city of Chicago, Park and Burgess elaborated a theory of urban ecology which proposed that cities were environments like those found in nature, governed by many of the same forces of Darwinian evolution that affected natural ecosystems. The most important of these forces was competition. Park and Burgess suggested that the struggle for scarce urban resources, especially land, led to competition between groups and ultimately to the division of the urban space into distinctive ecological niches or "natural areas" in which people shared similar social characteristics because they were subject to the same ecological pressures. Competition for land and resources ultimately led to the spatial differentiation of urban space into zones, with more desirable areas commanding higher rents. As they became more prosperous, people and businesses moved outward from the city center in a process Park and Burgess called succession, a term borrowed from plant ecology. Their model, known as concentric zone theory and first published in The City (1925), predicted that cities would take the form of five concentric rings with areas of social and physical deterioration concentrated near the city center and more prosperous areas located near the city's edge},

  abstract = {Markov chains have become a mainstay in the literature on regional income distribution dynamics and convergence. Despite its growing popularity, the Markov framework has some restrictive characteristics associated with the underlying discretization income distributions. This paper introduces several new approaches designed to mitigate some of the issues arising from discretization. Based on the examination of rank distributions, two new Markov-based chains are developed. The first explores the movement of individual economies through the income rank distribution over time. The second provides insight on the movements of ranks over geographical space and time. These also serve as the foundation for two new tests of spatial dynamics or the extent to which movements in the rank distribution are spatially clustered. An illustration of these new methods is included using income data for the lower 48 US states for the years 1929--2009.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the long-term impacts of the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) mortgage risk assessment maps on the spatial dynamics of recent income and racial distributions in California metropolitan areas over the 1990-2010 period. We combine historical HOLC boundaries with modern Census tract data and apply recently developed methods of spatial distribution dynamics to examine if legacy impacts are reflected in recent urban dynamics. Cities with HOLC assessments are found to have higher levels of isolation segregation than the non-HOLC group, but no difference in unevenness segregation between the two groups of cities are found. We find no difference in income or racial and ethnic distributional dynamics between the two groups of cities over the period. At the intra-urban scale, we find that the intersectionality of residing in a C or D graded tract that is also a low-income tract falls predominately upon the minority populations in these eight HOLC cities. Our findings indicate that neighborhoods with poor housing markets and high minority concentrations rarely experience a dramatic change in either their racial and ethnic or socioeconomic compositions---and that negative externalities (e.g. lower home prices and greater segregation levels) emanate from these neighborhoods, with inertia spilling over into nearby zones.},

  abstract = {There is a long cartographic tradition of describing cities through a focus on the characteristics of their residents. A review of the history of this type of urban social analysis highlights some persistent challenges. In this paper existing geodemographic approaches are extended through coupling the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), a data-mining technique, with geographic information systems (GIS). This approach allows the construction of linked maps of social (attribute) and geographic space. This novel type of geodemographic classification allows ad hoc hierarchical groupings and exploration of the relationship between social similarity and geographic proximity. It allows one to filter complex demographic datasets and is capable of highlighting general social patterns while retaining the fundamental social fingerprints of a city. A dataset describing 79 attributes of the 2217 census tracts in New York City is analyzed to illustrate the technique. Pairs of social and geographic maps are formally compared using simple pattern metrics. Our analysis of New York City calls into question some assumptions about the functional form of spatial relationships that underlie many modeling and statistical techniques. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
