  title: Funix - The laziest way to build GUI apps in Python
  subtitle: Make it (the app) before they fake it (in Figma or on a napkin)
  description: Presenting a model or algorithm as a GUI application is a common need in the scientific and engineering community.  Funix was created to automatically launch apps from existing Python functions, automatically selecting widgets based on the types of the arguments and returning functions according to the type-to-widget mapping defined in a theme.
