With the latter performing vastly better than the former, the need for annotated datasets is high, but they are costly and laborious to obtain. This review explores a family of approaches existing between the supervised and the unsupervised problem setting. The goal of these algorithms is to make more efficient use of the available labeled data. The advantages and limitations of each approach are addressed and perspectives are provided.}

  abstract = {Background: Convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods provide an efficient and automated way for clinicians to assess the structure and function of the heart in cardiac MR images. While CNNs can generally perform the segmentation tasks with high accuracy when training and test images come from the same domain (e.g., same scanner or site), their performance often degrades dramatically on images from different scanners or clinical sites.Methods: We propose a simple yet effective way for improving the network generalization ability by carefully designing data normalization and augmentation strategies to accommodate common scenarios in multi-site, multi-scanner clinical imaging data sets. We demonstrate that a neural network trained on a single-site single-scanner dataset from the UK Biobank can be successfully applied to segmenting cardiac MR images across different sites and different scanners without substantial loss of accuracy. Specifically, the method was trained on a large set of 3,975 subjects from the UK Biobank. It was then directly tested on 600 different subjects from the UK Biobank for intra-domain testing and two other sets for cross-domain testing: the ACDC dataset (100 subjects, 1 site, 2 scanners) and the BSCMR-AS dataset (599 subjects, 6 sites, 9 scanners).Results: The proposed method produces promising segmentation results on the UK Biobank test set which are comparable to previously reported values in the literature, while also performing well on cross-domain test sets, achieving a mean Dice metric of 0.90 for the left ventricle, 0.81 for the myocardium, and 0.82 for the right ventricle on the ACDC dataset; and 0.89 for the left ventricle, 0.83 for the myocardium on the BSCMR-AS dataset.Conclusions: The proposed method offers a potential solution to improve CNN-based model generalizability for the cross-scanner and cross-site cardiac MR image segmentation task.}

  abstract = {We assessed the generalizability of deep learning models and how to improve it. Our exemplary use-case was the detection of apical lesions on panoramic radiographs. We employed two datasets of panoramic radiographs from two centers, one in Germany (Charit{\'e}, Berlin, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}650) and one in India (KGMU, Lucknow, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}650): First, U-Net type models were trained on images from Charit{\'e} (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}500) and assessed on test sets from Charit{\'e} and KGMU (each n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}150). Second, the relevance of image characteristics was explored using pixel-value transformations, aligning the image characteristics in the datasets. Third, cross-center training effects on generalizability were evaluated by stepwise replacing Charite with KGMU images. Last, we assessed the impact of the dental status (presence of root-canal fillings or restorations). Models trained only on Charit{\'e} images showed a (mean{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}SD) F1-score of 54.1{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.8{\%} on Charit{\'e} and 32.7{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.8{\%} on KGMU data (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001/t-test). Alignment of image data characteristics between the centers did not improve generalizability. However, by gradually increasing the fraction of KGMU images in the training set (from 0 to 100{\%}) the F1-score on KGMU images improved (46.1{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.9{\%}) at a moderate decrease on Charit{\'e} images (50.9{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.9{\%}, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.01). Model performance was good on KGMU images showing root-canal fillings and/or restorations, but much lower on KGMU images without root-canal fillings and/or restorations. Our deep learning models were not generalizable across centers. Cross-center training improved generalizability. Noteworthy, the dental status, but not image characteristics were relevant. Understanding the reasons behind limits in generalizability helps to mitigate generalizability problems.},

  abstract = {Labeled medical imaging data is scarce and expensive to generate. To achieve generalizable deep learning models large amounts of data are needed. Standard data augmentation is a method to increase generalizability and is routinely performed. Generative adversarial networks offer a novel method for data augmentation. We evaluate the use of CycleGAN for data augmentation in CT segmentation tasks. Using a large image database we trained a CycleGAN to transform contrast CT images into non-contrast images. We then used the trained CycleGAN to augment our training using these synthetic non-contrast images. We compared the segmentation performance of a U-Net trained on the original dataset compared to a U-Net trained on the combined dataset of original data and synthetic non-contrast images. We further evaluated the U-Net segmentation performance on two separate datasets: The original contrast CT dataset on which segmentations were created and a second dataset from a different hospital containing only non-contrast CTs. We refer to these 2 separate datasets as the in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, respectively. We show that in several CT segmentation tasks performance is improved significantly, especially in out-of-distribution (noncontrast CT) data. For example, when training the model with standard augmentation techniques, performance of segmentation of the kidneys on out-of-distribution non-contrast images was dramatically lower than for in-distribution data (Dice score of 0.09 vs. 0.94 for out-of-distribution vs. in-distribution data, respectively, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). When the kidney model was trained with CycleGAN augmentation techniques, the out-of-distribution (non-contrast) performance increased dramatically (from a Dice score of 0.09 to 0.66, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). Improvements for the liver and spleen were smaller, from 0.86 to 0.89 and 0.65 to 0.69, respectively. We believe this method will be valuable to medical imaging researchers to reduce manual segmentation effort and cost in CT imaging.},
