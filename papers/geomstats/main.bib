@inproceedings{Ng2014,
abstract = {We present a Riemannian approach for classifying fMRI connectivity patterns before and after intervention in longitudinal studies. A fundamental difficulty with using connectivity as features is that covariance matrices live on the positive semi-definite cone, which renders their elements inter-related. The implicit independent feature assumption in most classifier learning algorithms is thus violated. In this paper, we propose a matrix whitening transport for projecting the covariance estimates onto a common tangent space to reduce the statistical dependencies between their elements. We show on real data that our approach provides significantly higher classification accuracy than directly using Pearson's correlation. We further propose a non-parametric scheme for identifying significantly discriminative connections from classifier weights. Using this scheme, a number of neuroanatomically meaningful connections are found, whereas no significant connections are detected with pure permutation testing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

  abstract = 	 {Hyperbolic embeddings offer excellent quality with few dimensions when embedding hierarchical data structures. We give a combinatorial construction that embeds trees into hyperbolic space with arbitrarily low distortion without optimization. On WordNet, this algorithm obtains a mean-average-precision of 0.989 with only two dimensions, outperforming existing work by 0.11 points. We provide bounds characterizing the precision-dimensionality tradeoff inherent in any hyperbolic embedding. To embed general metric spaces, we propose a hyperbolic generalization of multidimensional scaling (h-MDS). We show how to perform exact recovery of hyperbolic points from distances, provide a perturbation analysis, and give a recovery result that enables us to reduce dimensionality. Finally, we extract lessons from the algorithms and theory above to design a scalable PyTorch-based implementation that can handle incomplete information.}

However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information. We propose a research strategy to achieve this goal, and discuss its potential impact.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) is typically represented as a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix. Analysis methods that exploit the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices appropriately adhere to the positive definite constraint, unlike Euclidean methods. Recently proposed approaches for rsfMRI analysis have achieved high accuracy on public datasets, but are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret. In this paper, we show that we can get comparable results using connectivity matrices under the log-Euclidean and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics with relatively simple and interpretable models. On ABIDE Preprocessed dataset, our methods classify autism versus control subjects with 71.1{\%} accuracy. We also show that Riemannian methods beat baseline in regressing connectome features to subject autism severity scores.},
