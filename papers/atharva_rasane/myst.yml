  title: AI-Driven Watermarking Technique for Safeguarding Text Integrity in the Digital Age
  description: Identifying the sources is vital for generative AI models, like ChatGPT and Bard, due to concerns about copyright infringement and plagiarism. In this paper, we explore text watermarking as a potential solution. We investigate techniques including physical watermarking and logical watermarking.
