Description: A copy & paste backport of Python 3.3's ``shutil.which`` function.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        First, install the package: ``pip install shutilwhich``
        
        Importing the package::
        
          import shutilwhich
        
        will monkey-patch the ``shutil`` package, so from that point on you can simply
        import the ``which`` function::
        
          from shutil import which
        
        To keep things a little more concise, you can also import ``which`` directly
        from ``shutilwhich``::
        
          from shutilwhich import which
        
        This will still monkeypatch the ``shutil`` module. On Python 3.3 and above, the
        module never do anything but return the stdlib ``shutil.which`` function.
