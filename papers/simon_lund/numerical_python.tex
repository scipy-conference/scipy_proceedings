Numerical Python
----------------

Before describing the design of cphVB, we will briefly go through Numerical Python (NumPy) [Oli07]_. Numerical Python heavily influenced many design decisions in cphVB – it also uses a vector oriented programming model as cphVB.

NumPy is a library for numerical operations in Python, which is implemented in the C programming language. NumPy provides the programmer with a multidimensional array object and a whole range of supported array operations. By using the array operations, NumPy takes advantage of efficient C-implementations while retaining the high abstraction level of Python.

NumPy uses an array syntax that is based on the Python list syntax. The arrays are indexed positionally, 0 through length – 1, where negative indexes is used for indexing in the reversed order. Like the list syntax in Python, it is possible to index multiple elements. All indexing that represents more than one element returns a view of the elements rather than a new copy of the elements. It is this view semantic that makes it possible to implement a stencil operation as illustrated in Figure :ref:`fig-stencil-expr` and demonstrated in the code example below. In order to force a real array copy rather than a new array reference NumPy provides the ''copy'' method.

In the rest of this paper, we define the **array-base** as the originally allocated array that lies contiguously in memory. In addition, we will define the **array-view** as a view of the elements in an **array-base**. An **array-view** is usually a subset of the elements in the **array-base** or a re-ordering such as the reverse order of the elements or a combination.

   center = full[1:-1, 1:-1]
   up     = full[0:-2, 1:-1]
   down   = full[2:  , 1:-1]
   left   = full[1:-1, 0:-2]
   right  = full[1:-1, 2:  ]
   while epsilon < delta:
       work[:] = center
       work += 0.2 * (up+down+left+right)
       center[:] = work
