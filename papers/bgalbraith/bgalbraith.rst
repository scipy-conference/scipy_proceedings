Unlock: A Python-based framework for rapid development of practical brain-computer interface applications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   The Unlock Project aims to provide brain-computer interface (BCI)
   technologies to individuals suffering from locked-in syndrome, the complete
   or near-complete loss of voluntary motor function. While several BCI
   techniques have been demonstrated as feasible in a laboratory setting,
   limited effort has been devoted to translating that research into a system
   for viable home use. This is in large part due to the complexity of existing
   BCI software packages which are geared toward clinical use by domain
   experts. With Unlock, we have developed a Python-based modular framework
   that greatly simplifies the time and programming expertise needed to develop
   BCI applications and experiments. Furthermore, the entire Unlock system,
   including data acquisition, brain signal decoding, user interface display,
   and device actuation, can run on a single laptop, offering exceptional
   portability for this class of BCI.

   We present the current Unlock framework, along with examples from our
   work with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP).
