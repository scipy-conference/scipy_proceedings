Using Python to Study Rotational Velocity Distributions of Hot Stars
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Stars are a fundamental pieces that compose our Universe. By studying them we can better comprehend the enviroment in which we live. On this work, we have studied a sample of almost 400 nearby OB stars and have  characterized them in aspects of their temperature and projected rotational velocity.
   
   Python is a robust language with a steep learning curve, i.e. one can make rapid progress with it. In this proceeding, we will be discussing our  progress in learing Python at the same time in which the research were being made.
