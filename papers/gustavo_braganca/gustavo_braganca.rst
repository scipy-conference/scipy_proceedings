Using Python to Study Rotational Velocity Distributions of Hot Stars
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Stars are a fundamental pieces that compose our Universe. By studying them we can better comprehend the enviroment in which we live. On this work, we have studied a sample of almost 400 nearby OB stars and have  characterized them in aspects of their temperature and projected rotational velocity.
   
   Python is a robust language with a steep learning curve, i.e. one can make rapid progress with it. In this proceeding, we will be discussing our  progress in learning Python at the same time in which the research were being made.

Introduction
------------

The study of O and B stars are an important key to understand how star formation occurs. When these stars born, they have the greatest mass, temperature and rotation. Their mass can achieve **.....**, their temperatures, **....**, and rotation up to 400 km/s. 

When stars born, they start synthetizing Hydrogen into Helium through nuclear fusion. They perform this nucleosynthesis during more or less 90% of their life. When stars are at this stage, we call them dwarfs. Most of our studied stars are dwarfs. Dwarf stars do not had enough time to loose their mass and so the most of their stellar properties are kept unchanged. This help us understand how this stars formed.

Stars are born inside molecular clouds, and, usually, a molecular cloud can generate several stars. After their formation, these stars compose a stellar association, that, in its infancy, is still gravitationally bounded. With their unchanged properties, it is possible to trace the membership of these stars and then verify if some stars are from the same association.

The Python programming language is very well suited to scientific studies. Also, on the last years, it has been widely adopted on the Astronomic community. Because this, several packages are being translated to python or just being created.
