Using Python to Study Rotational Velocity Distributions of Hot Stars
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Stars are a fundamental pieces that compose our Universe. By studying them we can better comprehend the enviroment in which we live. On this work, we have studied a sample of almost 400 nearby OB stars and have  characterized them in aspects of their temperature and projected rotational velocity.
   
   Python is a robust language with a steep learning curve, i.e. one can make rapid progress with it. In this proceeding, we will be discussing our  progress in learning Python at the same time in which the research were being made.

Introduction
------------

The study of O and B stars are an important key to understand how star formation occurs. When these stars born, they have the greatest mass, temperature and rotation. Their mass can achieve **.....**, their temperatures, **....**, and rotation up to 400 km/s. 

By definition, a star is born when it start synthetizing Hydrogen into Helium through nuclear fusion. The star perform this nucleosynthesis during somewhat 90% of their life. When stars are at this stage, they are called dwarfs. Most of the studied stars of this work are dwarfs. Due to their young age, dwarf stars do not have lost too much of their mass, and so, the most of their stellar properties are kept unchanged. This help us understand how this stars formed.

Stars are born inside molecular clouds, and, usually, a molecular cloud can generate several stars. After their formation, these stars compose a stellar association, that, in its infancy, is still gravitationally bounded. With their unchanged properties, it is possible to trace the membership of these stars and then verify if some stars are from the same association.

The Python programming language is very well suited to scientific studies. The scipy, numpy and matplotlib are the basic packages to start doing scientific research using python. Also, on the last years, it has been widely adopted on the Astronomic community. Because this, several packages are being translated to python or just being created. The existence of these packages are one of the reasons that attracted us to use python on our research. Its easy learning and its script nature are other reasons as well. The script nature allows the researcher to have a dynamic workflow and not to loose too much time with debugging and compiling.

On this proceedings, we relate how we used python on our research. A more profound scientific analysis can be found at [Brag12]_
