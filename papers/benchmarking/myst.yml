  title: Evaluating Probabilistic Forecasters with sktime and tsbootstrap â€” Easy-to-Use, Configurable Frameworks for Reproducible Science
  description: Evaluating probabilistic forecasts is complex and essential across various domains, yet no comprehensive software framework exists to simplify this task. Despite extensive literature on evaluation methodologies, current practices are fragmented and often lack reproducibility. To address this gap, we introduce a reproducible experimental workflow for evaluating probabilistic forecasting algorithms using the sktime package.
