title: 'Any notebook served: authoring and sharing reusable interactive widgets'
abstract: |
  The open-source Jupyter project has fostered a robust ecosystem around
  notebook-based computing, resulting in diverse Jupyter-compatible platforms
  (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab, VS Code). Jupyter Widgets extend these
  environments with custom visualizations and interactive elements that
  communicate directly with user code and data. While this bidirectional
  communication makes the widget system powerful, its architecture is currently
  tightly coupled to platforms. As a result, widgets are complex and error-prone
  to author and distribute, limiting the potential of the wider widget ecosystem.
  Here we describe the motivation and approach behind the _anywidget_ project,
  a specification and toolset for portable and reusable web-based widgets in
  interactive computing environments. It ensures cross-platform compatibility
  by using the web browser’s built-in module system to load these modules from
  the notebook kernel. This design simplifies widget authorship and distribution,
  enables rapid prototyping, and lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers.
  Anywidget is compatible with not just Jupyter-compatible platforms but any web-based notebook
  platform or authoring environment and is already adopted by other projects.
  Its adoption has sparked a widget renaissance, improving reusability,
  interoperability, and making interactive computing more accessible.

## Introduction

Computational notebooks combine live code, equations, prose, visualizations,
and other media within a single environment. The Jupyter project
[@Kluyver2016; @Granger2021] has been instrumental the success of
notebooks, which have become the tool of choice for interactive computing in
data science, research, and education. Key to Jupyter's widespread adoption is
its modular architecture and standardization of interacting components, which
have fostered an extensive ecosystem of tools that reuse these elements. For
example, the programs responsible for executing code written in notebooks,
called **kernels**, can be implemented by following the Jupyter Messaging
Protocol [@doc_jupmsgprotocol]. This design allows users to install kernels for
various different languages and types of computation. Similarly, Jupyter's
open-standard notebook format (`.ipynb`) ensures that notebooks can be shared
and interpreted across different platforms [@doc_jupnbformat].

Jupyter’s modular architecture has also supported innovation in **notebook
front ends** — the user interfaces (UIs) for editing and executing code, as
well as inspecting kernel outputs. The success of the classic Jupyter Notebook
[@Kluyver2016] spurred the development of several similar Jupyter-compatible
platforms (JCPs), such as JupyterLab, Google Colab, and Visual Studio Code.
These platforms provide unique UIs and editing features while reusing Jupyter's
other standardized components. This interoperability allows users to choose the
platform that best suits their needs, while retaining a familiar interactive
computing experience with the ability to share notebooks. Furthermore, the
separation of computation from UI offers users a wide selection of both front
ends and kernels. However, the proliferation of JCPs has led to significant
challenges for Jupyter Widgets, a key component of interactive user interfaces
in Jupyter.

**Jupyter Widgets** extend notebook outputs with interactive views and controls
for objects residing in the kernel [@doc_juparch]. For instance, the
[ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) library, besides
defining the widget communication protocol, provides basic form elements like
buttons, sliders, and dropdowns to adjust individual variables. Other community
projects offer interactive visualizations for domain-specific needs, such as 3D
volume rendering ([ipyvolume](https://github.com/widgetti/ipyvolume)),
biological data exploration [@manzt2023; @viv; @vitessce], and mapping
([ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet),
[pydeck](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/master/bindings/pydeck),
[lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/)), which users can update by
executing other code cells or interact with in the UI to update properties in
the kernel.

Widgets are unique among Jupyter components in that they consist of two
separate programs — kernel-side code and front-end code — that communicate
directly via custom messages [@fig:overview], rather than through a mediating
Jupyter process. With widgets, communication is bidirectional: a kernel action
(e.g., the execution of a notebook cell) can update the UI, such as causing a
slider to move, while a user interaction (e.g., dragging a slider), can drive
changes in the kernel, like updating a variable. This two-way communication
distinguishes widgets from other interactive elements in notebook outputs, such
as HTML displays, which cannot communicate back and forth with the kernel.

:label: fig:overview
Jupyter Widget conceptual architecture.
:::

Widgets are intended to be pluggable components, similar to kernels. However,
only the protocol for communication between kernel and front-end widget code,
known as the [Jupyter Widgets Message
Protocol](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/c65dc47/packages/schema/messages.md),
is standardized. Critical components, such as the distribution format for
front-end modules and methods for discovering, loading, and executing these
modules, remain unspecified. As a result, JCPs have adopted diverse third-party
module formats, installation procedures, and execution models to support
widgets. These inconsistencies place the onus on widget authors to ensure
cross-JCP compatibility.

:::{note}
In this paper, we define a Jupyter Widget as consisting of a pair of programs:
kernel-side and front-end, which communicate via the Jupyter Widget Message
Protocol. While Python-only widget classes exist, which wrap other Jupyter
Widgets as dependencies, this paper focuses on those with dedicated front-end
code, where the challenges described apply.
:::

JCPs load front-end widget code by searching in various external sources, such
as local file systems or Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) while kernel-side
(Python) code loads and runs in the kernel [@fig:before-afm]. These access
patterns split the distribution of custom widgets between Python and JavaScript
package registries, complicating releases and requiring widget authors to
understand both packaging ecosystems. This division creates challenges,
especially in shared, multi-user environments like
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub). Since kernels cannot host static assets,
users cannot independently install widgets or manage versions. Instead, widget
front-end code must be pre-installed on the Jupyter webserver, typically by an
administrator. Consequently, users are restricted to administrator-installed
widgets and versions, unable to upgrade or add new ones independently.

:::{figure} dev-before-afm-01.svg
:label: fig:before-afm
Without anywidget, to ensure compatibility, authors must transform their
JavaScript code for each JCP. Since JCPs load front-end widget code from a
webserver rather than the kernel, widget front-end and Python code must also be
packaged separately and installed consistently on any given platform.
Missing puzzle pieces represent missing front-end extensions for specific
target JCPs. The misshapen blue piece represents an incorrectly built or broken
extension. Both situations contribute to fragmented JCP support.
:::

These limitations make widget development complex and time-consuming, demanding
expertise in multiple domains. They make user experiences across JCPs
frustrating and unreliable. The high barrier to entry discourages new developers
and domain scientists from contributing to widgets, limiting growth and
diversity in the ecosystem. This leaves a small group of authors responsible for
adapting their code for cross-JCP compatibility, hindering widget
reliability and maintainability.

## Methodology

The [**anywidget**](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget) project simplifies the
authoring, sharing, and distribution of Jupyter Widgets by (i) introducing a
standard for widget front-end code based on the web browser’s native module
system, (ii) loading these modules from the kernel, and (iii) providing the
necessary "glue code" to adapt existing JCPs to load and execute these
components [@fig:after-afm]. This separation of concerns allows widget authors
to write portable code that runs consistently across JCPs without manual
installation steps.

:::{figure} dev-after-afm-02.svg
:label: fig:after-afm
With anywidget, developers author a single, standard portable ES
module (AFM), which is loaded from the kernel and executed using the browser's
native module system. For existing JCPs, anywidget provides a front-end adapter
to load and execute these standardized modules, while new platforms can add
native AFM support directly. Widget kernel-side code and AFM can be run
directly from within notebooks, from source files, or distributed as single
Python packages. With anywidget, each JCP consumes the same AFM, and widget
authors can compose an AFM directly or target AFM through a build step to
take advantage of advanced tools.
:::

Packaging custom Jupyter Widgets is complex due to the need to adapt JavaScript
source code for various module systems used by JCPs. Initially, JavaScript
lacked a built-in module system, leading JCPs to adopt diverse third-party
solutions. Without a standardized widget front-end format, authors transform
their code for each JCP. In the context of Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab,
this problem is described in the Jupyter Widgets documentation [@doc_widgets]
as follows:

> Because the API of any given widget must exist in the kernel, the kernel is
> the natural place for widgets to be installed. However, kernels, as of now,
> don’t host static assets. Instead, static assets are hosted by the webserver,
> which is the entity that sits between the kernel and the front-end. This is a
> problem because it means widgets have components that need to be installed
> both in the webserver and the kernel. The kernel components are easy to
> install, because you can rely on the language’s built-in tools. The static
> assets for the webserver complicate things, because an extra step is required
> to let the webserver know where the assets are.

ECMAScript (ES) modules, introduced in 2015, are an official standard for
packaging JavaScript code for reuse [@ecma]. While most JCPs predate its
standardization, ES modules are universally supported by browsers today. By
adopting ES modules, anywidget is able to use the browser's native import
mechanism to load and execute widget front-end code from the Jupyter kernel,
thereby bypassing those used by JCPs and eliminating third-party dependencies.
This approach not only overcomes many development challenges, but also
eliminates installation procedures for front-end code. Consequently, developers
can prototype and share widgets directly within notebooks, making them more
reliable and easier to use.

An anywidget front-end module (AFM) is an ES module with a `default` export
defining widget behavior. This export includes lifecycle methods, or "hooks,"
for managing a widget's lifecycle stages: initialization, rendering, and
destruction [@fig:afm]. AFM lifecycle methods receive the interfaces required
for kernel communication and notebook output modifications as arguments, rather
than creating them internally or relying on global variables provided by the
JCP. This practice, known as dependency injection [@Fowler2004], improves AFM
portability by making integration interfaces explicit. New runtimes can support
AFMs by implementing the required APIs, and existing JCPs can refactor their
internals without breaking existing (any)widgets. For projects that want to take
advantage of advanced front-end tooling, anywidget also provides authoring
utilities to write AFMs such as "bridge" libraries for popular web frameworks
[@joss].

:::{figure}
:label: fig:afm

```{code-block}javascript
export default {
  initialize({ model }) {
    // Set up shared state or event handlers.
    return () => {
      // Optional: Called when the widget is destroyed.
    }
  },
  render({ model, el }) {
    // Render the widget's view into the el HTMLElement.
    return () => {
      // Optional: Called when the view is destroyed.
    }
  }
}
```

An anywidget front-end module (AFM) with initialization and rendering lifecycle
methods. For familiarity, AFM methods use naming conventions from traditional
Jupyter Widgets; however, AFM [narrows down the
APIs](https://observablehq.com/@manzt/afm-narrowing-widget-front-end-apis)
provided to these methods, making it easier to load and execute AFMs in
new environments. _Methods_: The `initialize` and `render` methods correspond
to different stages in the widget's lifecycle. During model initialization, a
front-end model is created and synchronized with the kernel. In the rendering
stage, each notebook cell displaying a widget object renders an independent
view based on the synced model state. _Arguments_: The interface of `model` is
restricted to a minimal set of methods for communicating with the kernel
(retrieving, updating, and responding to value changes). The `el` argument is a
standard web
[`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).
:::

Widget authorship is particularly challenging due to the need to integrate
front-end code that communicates with kernel code in a heterogeneous set of
environments. The anywidget project addresses these challenges by focusing on
the standardization, development, and distribution of widget front-end modules,
including the associated API to communicate with a computational kernel. The
anywidget Python package serves as an adapter library that turns each JCP into
an AFM-compatible host environment. Finally, the anywidget project provides
additional tooling to help developers evolve their prototypes into mature
packages [@joss].

An additional goal for an interactive computing paradigm like widgets is
composability. For example, ipywidgets provides utilities to link widgets
together or lay out grids of widgets on the page. These primitives allow
widgets to derive from others, enabling reuse of front-end and kernel
integrations in new ways. Importantly, Jupyter Widgets authored with the
anywidget Python package extend from ipywidgets, making them interoperable with
core ipywidgets and traditional custom widgets. By aligning with ipywidgets,
anywidget promotes composability and prevents fragmentation of the ecosystem.

## Features

Adhering to predictable standards benefits both developers and end users in
many other ways beyond JCP interoperability, such as...

### Web Over Libraries

Front-end libraries change rapidly and often introduce
breaking changes, whereas the web platform remains more backward-compatible.
Traditional Jupyter Widgets require extensions from UI libraries provided by
JCPs, coupling widget implementations to third-party frameworks. In contrast,
AFM defines a minimal set of essential interfaces focused on (1) communicating
with the kernel and (2) modifying notebook output cells, without dictating
models for state or UI. It allows widgets to be defined without dependencies,
reducing boilerplate and preventing lock-in. Authors may still use third-party
JavaScript libraries or tooling, but these are no longer necessary for JCP
compatibility, publishing, or user installation.

### Rapid Iteration

The web ecosystem's adoption of ES modules has led to new technologies that
enhance developer experience and enable rapid prototyping. One such innovation
is hot module replacement (HMR), a method that uses the browser’s module graph
to dynamically update applications without reloading the page or losing state.
Since traditional Jupyter Widgets rely on legacy module systems, they cannot
benefit from HMR and instead require full page clearance, reload, and
re-execution to see changes during development. By contrast, anywidget is able
to provide opt-in HMR, implemented through the Jupyter messaging protocol, in
order to support live development of custom widgets without any front-end
tooling. For example, adjusting a widget's appearance, such as a chart's color
scheme, updates the view instantly without re-executing cells or refreshing the
page.

### Progressive Development

Anywidget makes it possible to prototype widgets directly within a notebook
since all widget code is loaded from the kernel. Custom widgets can start as a
few code cells and transition to separate files, gradually evolving into
standalone scripts or packages – just like kernel-side programs
[@fig:after-afm]. In contrast, developing traditional Jupyter Widgets is a
cumbersome process limited to the Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab platforms. It
involves using a project generator [@js_cookiecutter; @ts_cookiecutter] to
bootstrap a project with over 50 files, creating and installing a local Python
package, bundling JavaScript code, and manually linking build outputs to
install extensions [@cookiecutter_comparison]. By removing these barriers,
anywidget accelerates development and allows prototypes to grow into robust
tools over time. In fact, as of January 2024, the JavaScript cookiecutter
[@js_cookiecutter] project has been deprecated and directs users to use
anywidget instead.

### Simplified Publishing

Serving AFMs and other static assets from the kernel
removes the need to publish widget kernel-side and front-end code separately and
coordinate their releases. For example, many JCPs retrieve traditional widget
Javascript code from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), misusing the registry for
distributing specialized programs rather than reusable JavaScript modules.
Instead, with anywidget, developers can publish a widget (kernel-side module,
AFM, and stylesheets) as a unified package to the distribution channels
relevant to the kernel language, such as the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).
Consolidating the distribution process this way greatly simplifies publishing
and discovery.

## Impact and Outlook

Anywidget fills in the specification gaps for Jupyter Widgets by embracing open
standards and carefully separating developer concerns. It defines an API for
authoring portable and reusable widget components that decouples widget
authorship from JCPs, resulting in multiple downstream benefits. First,
anywidget—not widget authors—ensures compatibility and interoperability across
existing JCPs, and authors can focus on important features rather than wrestle
with build configuration and tooling. Anywidget’s adapter layer simply loads
and executes standardized front-end modules, meaning that the compatibility
afforded does not introduce overhead to the runtime performance of a widget
itself. A widget authored with anywidget has the same performance
characteristics as a widget tediously (and correctly) authored using the
traditional Jupyter Widgets system. Second, by circumventing bespoke JCP import
systems and loading web-standard ES modules from the kernel, anywidget does
away with manual installation steps and delivers an improved developer
experience during widget authorship. Third, anywidget unifies and simplifies
widget distribution. Widgets can be prototyped and shared as notebooks, or
mature into `pip`-installable packages and distributed like other tools in the
Python data science ecosystem. End users benefit from standardization because
widgets are easy to install and behave consistently across platforms.

Since its release, anywidget has led to a proliferation of widgets and a more
diverse widget ecosystem [@fig:widgetstats]. New widgets range from educational
tools for experimenting with toy datasets (e.g.,
[DrawData](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata)) to high-performance data visualization
libraries (e.g., [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/),
[Jupyter-Scatter](https://jupyter-scatter.dev/) [@jscatter],
[Mosaic](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic) [@Heer2024]) and research
projects enhancing notebook interactivity (e.g.,
[Persist](https://github.com/visdesignlab/persist/) [@Gadhave2023],
[cev](https://github.com/OzetteTech/comparative-embedding-visualization)
[@manz2024cev]). Many of these tools use anywidget's binary data transport to
enable efficient interactive visualization with minimal overhead by avoiding
JSON serialization. Existing widget projects have also migrated to anywidget
(e.g., [higlass-python](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-python),
[ipyaladin](https://github.com/cds-astro/ipyaladin)) and other libraries have
introduced or refactored existing widget functionality to use anywidget (e.g.,
[Altair](https://github.com/vega/altair) [@VanderPlas2018]) due to the
simplified distribution and authoring capabilities.

:::

The portable widget standard also extends the anywidget ecosystem to platforms
beyond Jupyter. Popular web frameworks and dashboarding libraries such as
[Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila),
[Panel](https://github.com/holoviz/panel), [Shiny for
Python](https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny), and
[Solara](https://github.com/widgetti/solara) support Jupyter Widgets, and
therefore also allow users to embed anywidgets in standalone web applications.
Efforts are underway to add more specialized, built-in support for AFM as well.
For example, [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo), a new reactive
notebook for Python, is standardizing its third-party plugin API on AFM,
allowing anywidgets to run natively without additional "glue code." Developers
of the Panel web-application framework are also exploring deeper integration
with AFM to enable reuse with their kernel-side reactivity systems.

AFM's standardization of widget front-end code extends reusability beyond the
Python ecosystem. Its API structure is intentionally agnostic to backend
processing, enabling creative and dynamic ways of hosting AFM-based widgets.
Many simple widgets can function without any compute backend, while more
complex ones can be upgraded with a computational backend when necessary. This
flexibility allows for innovative hosting solutions across diverse platforms,
from fully static web pages to full-stack web applications. By decoupling
front-end interactivity from backend complexity, AFM empowers developers to
create scalable, platform-independent scientific visualizations and tools,
adaptable to a wide range of computational requirements and user scenarios.

A current limitation of anywidget is that using relative file imports for local
dependencies requires bundling into a single ES module, which introduces a
build step and prevents shipping AFM source code directly. This build step can
be avoided by using a single file and loading third-party dependencies via
URLs, though larger projects may still benefit from bundling. Notably,
traditional widgets always require a build step and mandate using a specific
bundler (Webpack) with a bespoke multi-JCP configuration. In contrast,
anywidget makes bundling optional and targets a single standard ES module,
which can be produced easily from a variety of bundlers. Future browser support
for
[importmaps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
may enable local dependencies without bundling, simplifying anywidget
development further as web standards evolve.

Tools for data visualization and interactivity have greater impact when
compatible with more platforms, but achieving compatibility involves trade-offs
[@Wang2024]. The full capabilities of the widget system, such as
bidirectional communication, are often inaccessible to authors due to
development difficulty and maintenance efforts. Adopting standards can minimize
these impediments, enabling both broad compatibility and advanced capabilities
for users. A recent article enumerates these challenges and advocates for
standardized solutions to democratize the creation of notebook visualization
tools across notebook platforms [@Wang2024]. Anywidget addresses this by
introducing a standard that removes friction in widget development and sharing,
making authorship practical and accessible.
