               contextual elements and computer code, and computer-generated
               output from executing the computer code. Such outputs can
               include tables and plots. The notebook elements can be executed

               computational and data exploration, documentation,
               communication, reproducibility and re-usability of scientific

               mathematics---where domain-specific software was exposed to the
               Jupyter environment. This enables high level control of

               computational results, batch processing on HPC resources, and
               reproducible workflow documentation in Jupyter notebooks. In the
               first study, Ubermag drives existing computational
               micromagnetics software through a domain-specific language
               embedded in Python. In the second study, a dedicated Jupyter

               helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We

               interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the
               idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the

              and interoperability of interactive data views. Mosaic decouples
              data processing from specification logic: clients publish their
              data needs as declarative queries that are then managed and
              automatically optimized by a coordinator that proxies access to a
              scalable data store. Mosaic generalizes Vegalite's selection
              abstraction to enable rich integration and linking across
              visualizations and components such as menus, text search, and
              tables. We demonstrate Mosaic's expressiveness, extensibility,

              visualization, interaction, and optimization techniques-many
              constructed using vgplot, a grammar of interactive graphics in
              which graphical marks act as Mosaic clients. To evaluate

  abstract = "Computational notebooks, such as Jupyter, support rich data
              visualization. However, even when visualizations in notebooks are
              interactive, they still are a dead end: Interactive data
              manipulations, such as selections, applying labels, filters,
              categorizations, or fixes to column or cell values, could be
              efficiently apply in interactive visual components, but
              interactive components typically cannot manipulate Python data
              structures. Furthermore, actions performed in interactive plots
              are volatile, i.e., they are lost as soon as the cell is re-run,
              prohibiting reusability and reproducibility. To remedy this, we
              introduce Persist, a family of techniques to capture and apply
              interaction provenance to enable persistence of interactions.
              When interactions manipulate data, we make the transformed data
              available in dataframes that can be accessed in downstream code
              cells. We implement our approach as a JupyterLab extension that
              supports tracking interactions in Vega-Altair plots and in a data
              table view. Persist can re-execute the interaction provenance
              when a notebook or a cell is re-executed enabling reproducibility
              and re-use. We evaluated Persist in a user study targeting data
              manipulations with 11 participants skilled in Python and Pandas,
              comparing it to traditional code-based approaches. Participants
              were consistently faster with Persist, were able to correctly
              complete more tasks, and expressed a strong preference for
              Persist.",
