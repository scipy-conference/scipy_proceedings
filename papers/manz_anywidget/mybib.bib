              data needs as declarative queries that are then managed and
              automatically optimized by a coordinator that proxies access to a
              scalable data store. Mosaic generalizes Vegalite's selection

              visualization. However, even when visualizations in notebooks are
              interactive, they still are a dead end: Interactive data
              manipulations, such as selections, applying labels, filters,
              categorizations, or fixes to column or cell values, could be
              efficiently apply in interactive visual components, but
              interactive components typically cannot manipulate Python data
              structures. Furthermore, actions performed in interactive plots
              are volatile, i.e., they are lost as soon as the cell is re-run,
              prohibiting reusability and reproducibility. To remedy this, we
              introduce Persist, a family of techniques to capture and apply
              interaction provenance to enable persistence of interactions.
              When interactions manipulate data, we make the transformed data
              available in dataframes that can be accessed in downstream code
              cells. We implement our approach as a JupyterLab extension that
              supports tracking interactions in Vega-Altair plots and in a data
              table view. Persist can re-execute the interaction provenance
              when a notebook or a cell is re-executed enabling reproducibility
              and re-use. We evaluated Persist in a user study targeting data
              manipulations with 11 participants skilled in Python and Pandas,
              comparing it to traditional code-based approaches. Participants
              were consistently faster with Persist, were able to correctly
