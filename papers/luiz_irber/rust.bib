	abstract = {Renewable energy is the cornerstone of preventing dangerous climate change whilst maintaining a robust energy supply. Tidal energy will arguably play a critical role in the renewable energy portfolio as it is both predictable and reliable, and can be put in place across the globe. However, installation may impact the local and regional ecology via changes in tidal dynamics, sediment transport pathways or bathymetric changes. In order to mitigate these effects, tidal energy devices need to be modelled, to predict hydrodynamic changes. Robust mesh generation is a fundamental component required for developing simulations with high accuracy. However, mesh generation for coastal domains can be an elaborate procedure. Here, we describe an approach combining mesh generators with Geographical Information Systems. We demonstrate robustness and efficiency by constructing a mesh with which to examine the potential environmental impact of a tidal turbine farm installation in the Orkney Islands. The mesh is then used with two well-validated ocean models, to compare their flow predictions with and without a turbine array. The results demonstrate that it is possible to create an easy-to-use tool to generate high-quality meshes for combined coastal engineering, here tidal turbines, and coastal ocean simulations.},

	abstract = {Preprocessing of functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each new dataset, building upon a large inventory of tools available for each step. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in {MR} data acquisition and image processing techniques. We introduce {fMRIPrep}, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting {fMRI} data. {FMRIPrep} automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing with no manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software-testing, we show that {fMRIPrep} robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse {fMRI} data collection comprising participants from 54 different studies in the {OpenfMRI} repository. We review the distinctive features of {fMRIPrep} in a qualitative comparison to other preprocessing workflows. We demonstrate that {fMRIPrep} achieves higher spatial accuracy as it introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than one commonly used preprocessing tool. {FMRIPrep} has the potential to transform {fMRI} research by equipping neuroscientists with a high-quality, robust, easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of their results.},
