The DEVise framework is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number of user groups.Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.}, journal = {SIGMOD Rec.}, month = jun, pages = {301–312}, numpages = {12} }
