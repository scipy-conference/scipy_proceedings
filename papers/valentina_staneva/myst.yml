  title: 'Echodataflow: Recipe-based Fisheries Acoustics Workflow Orchestration'
  description: With the influx of large data from multiple instruments and experiments, scientists are wrangling complex data pipelines that are context-dependent and non-reproducible. Echodataflow provides transparent reproducible pipelines that can be edited with text "recipes", scaled and monitored.
