  title: Training a Supervised Cilia Segmentation Model from Self-Supervision
  description: Understanding cilia behavior is essential in diagnosing and treating such diseases, but, the tasks of automatically analyzing cilia are often a labor and time-intensive. In this work we overcome this bottleneck by developing a robust, self-supervised framework exploiting the visual similarity of normal and dysfunctional cilia.
