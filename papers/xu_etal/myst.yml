  title: Data Reduction Network
  description: Multidimensional categorical data is widespread but not easily visualized using standard methods. For example, questionnaire data generally consists of questions with categorical responses. Popular methods of handling categorical data include one-hot encoding and enumeration, which applies an unwarranted and potentially misleading notional order to the data. To address this, we introduce a novel visualization method named Data Reduction Network.
