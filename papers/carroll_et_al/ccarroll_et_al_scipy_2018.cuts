   Large, complicated, and poorly documented codebases make it difficult for economists using computational tools to understand each others' work. `Econ-ARK <http://econ-ark.org>`__ aims to address these problems by developing a set of resources and examples and standards of practice for communication among such researchers. The first step has been the creation of a toolkit for Heterogeneous Agent (HA) macroeconomics called the Heterogeneous-Agent Resources toolKit (HARK): A modular programming framework for solving, estimating, and simulating macroeconomic models in which economic agents can be heterogeneous in ways that are relevant for macroeconomic outcomes. To address the complexity of code sharing in economics research, the HARK project provides a set of well-documented code modules that can be combined to solve a range of core heterogeneous-agent models. The HARK project aims to apply best-practice software development approaches to the development of code in computational economics in order to increase researcher productivity, particularly when interacting with other researchersâ€™ code.
