  title: Ecological and Spatial Influences on the Genetics of Cumacea (Crustacea: Peracarida) in the Northern North Atlantic
  subtitle: by aPhyloGeo software
  description: The peracarid taxon Cumacea is an essential indicator of benthic quality in marine ecosystems. This study investigated the influence of environmental (i.e., biological or ecosystemic), climatic (i.e., meteorological or atmospheric), and spatial (i.e., geographic or regional) variables on their genetic variability and adaptability in the Northern North Atlantic, focusing on Icelandic waters.
