  title: Ecological and Spatial Influences on the Genetics of Cumacea (Crustacea: Peracarida) in the Northern North Atlantic
  subtitle: by aPhyloGeo software
  description: The peracarid taxon Cumacea is an essential indicator of benthic quality in marine ecosystems. This study investigated the influence of environmental (i.e., biological or ecosystemic), climatic (i.e., meteorological or atmospheric), and geographic (i.e., spatial or regional) attributes on their genetic variability in the Northern North Atlantic, focusing on Icelandic waters.
