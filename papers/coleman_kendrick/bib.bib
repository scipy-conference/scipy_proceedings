In McStas, components realise all physical elements of the simulated instrument from source via optics and samples to detector. In this second review paper of the McStas package, we present an overview of the component classes in McStas: sources , monitors , optics , samples , misc , and contrib . Within each component class we give thorough examples of high-quality components, including their algorithms and example use. We present two example instruments, one for a continuous source and one for a time-of-flight source, that together demonstrate the use of the main component classes. Finally, we give tips and instructions that will allow the reader to write good components and elucidate the pathway of contributing new components to McStas.},

	abstract = {Data analysis for neutron scattering experiments is driven by the scientific needs of the instrument users and varies greatly by technique and field of study. Data from an experiment must first be ``reduced'' so that instrument artifacts are removed, and then scientists must choose from a wide variety of tools and applications to assemble a workflow that enables useful scientific results to be extracted. The highly manual nature of this process, combined with difficulty accessing computational resources and data when needed, puts limits on the efficiency and nature of the analysis undertaken. In addition, other activities, such as tracking data provenance to ensure the analysis is reproducible, or providing live data analysis during experiment runs, are also difficult to achieve.},

	abstract = {A fine resolution chopper spectrometer (SEQUOIA) recently received first neutrons at the SNS. The commissioning phase of the instrument is underway. SEQUOIA is designed to utilize neutrons of an incident energy ( E i ) between 10-2000 meV. A monochromatic beam is provided on a sample, 20 m from the decoupled ambient temperature H 2 O moderator, by filtering the white beam with a Fermi chopper located 18 m from the source. After interacting with the sample, neutrons are detected by an array of 3 He linear position sensitive tubes located on a vertical cylinder with a radius of 5.5 m. This contribution presents current results from the commissioning experiments and compares SEQUOIA's actual and predicted performance. These commissioning experiments include characterization of the beam by monitors, determination of the chopper phase offsets, and runs with V and C 4 H 2 I 2 S. The predicted performance is provided by analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {A binary format with lists of particle state information, for interchanging particles between various Monte Carlo simulation applications, is presented. Portable C code for file manipulation is made available to the scientific community, along with converters and plugins for several popular simulation packages.
