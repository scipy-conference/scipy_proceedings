Campaign for IT literacy through FOSS and Spoken Tutorials
================================================================


.. class:: abstract

  This article explains an approach to promote Information Technology (IT)
  literacy in India, which has evolved into a pyramid structure. We begin this
  article by explaining the design decisions, such as the use of FOSS and
  being a friendly interface between beginners and experts, in undertaking
  this activity.

  A Spoken Tutorial is a ten minute audio video tutorial on open source
  software, created to provide training on important IT topics.  Spoken
  Tutorials are made suitable for self learning, through a novice check
  of the underlying script. The spoken part of these tutorials is dubbed
  in all Indian languages, to help children who are weak in English,
  while retaining employment potential. The effectiveness of conducting
  workshops using spoken tutorials is explained.  A total of 400,000
  students have been trained in the past three years through one or more
  Spoken Tutorial based Education and Learning through Free FOSS study
  (SELF) workshops.
  
  Students who undergo SELF workshops can create textbook companions, which
  contain code for the solved problems of given textbooks using a particular
  software. A Python Textbook Companion is a collection of Python code for a
  given textbook. These companions and the associated textbook, together, form
  a low cost document for Python in general, and the textbook, in particular.
  We have completed approximately 80 Python Textbook Companions and another 80
  are in progress. From textbook companions, the students can progress to lab
  migration activity, the objective of which is to migrate labs based on
  proprietary software to FOSS. Interested students are trained to use FOSS
  systems in their projects and to contribute to the development of new FOSS
  systems. Using this approach and Python as a glue language, we have
  developed the following new FOSS systems: 1. Oscad, an electronic design
  automation tool, and a FOSS alternative to commercial software, such as
  ORCAD. 2. Sandhi, a block diagram based data acquisition for real time
  control, and a FOSS alternative to commercial software, such as LabVIEW.

  The pyramid structure explained in this work helps the beginners to become
  IT literate. Our design solutions are especially suitable to poor and
  marginalised sections of the society, which is at the bottom of the social
  pyramid. Our efforts to create and promote the world’s lowest cost computing
  system Aakash is briefly addressed in this work.

Introduction
============

This article explains the approach we have taken to promote IT literacy
in India. While India has the capability to create software to help
improve the lives of people around the world, its citizens do not have
the capability to absorb it. One main reason is that India does not have
a good infrastructure. In addition, the economic conditions do not allow
our citizens in general, and students in particular, to buy expensive
hardware and software. Lack of good quality educational institutions and
good teachers compound the problem.

This paper begins with the design decisions we have taken to achieve
our objective while keeping in mind the problems mentioned above. Some
of the decisions have been arrived at by trial and error, while some
decisions, such as the use of FOSS, have been a cornerstone of our
efforts.  The next section explains a procedure we use to train a
large number of students through FOSS and spoken tutorials.  The
textbook companion section explains how we create low cost
documentation for FOSS through textbook companions.  We follow this
with a section on lab migration that helps shift lab courses based on
proprietary software to FOSS.  After this, we explain how these
activities lead to a pyramid structure.  Finally, we discuss the
relevance of the low cost computing device Aakash, and conclude.
We emphasize the role of Python in all of the above.

Approach and Design Decisions
=============================

We started in 2009 the effort explained in this article, to promote
FOSS, with the Indian Government support and funding [nm09]_. Although
there are many good FOSS systems, they are difficult to use because of
lack of documentation and support. If we could bridge this gap, FOSS
would become accessible to our students, who do not have access to
good software otherwise, as many of them are proprietary in nature. We
also did not want to promote commercial software with tax payer’s
money. Our funding agency [nm09]_ had also made a policy decision to
exclusively use FOSS.

It does not mean that we wanted to erect a wall between us and those who
use commercial software. We do work with students who only know how to
use the MS Windows operating system, for example. We do accept tutorials
that have been dubbed with Windows Movie Maker. We believe that by
creating a good ecosystem, we can shift proprietary software users to
equivalent FOSS systems. We have always wished to be an inclusive
project.

We have been using simple technologies to create our instructional material,
as these allow school going students also to participate in the creation
effort. For example, we have eschewed the use of instructional methodologies
that help embed interaction in our tutorials. In contrast, open source screen
recording software, such as RecordMyDesktop [rmd]_, has limited features.
Nevertheless, we have made the learning effective by developing strict
processes in creation [guidelines]_ and use of Spoken Tutorials, such
as, the side-by-side
method (see Fig. :ref:`fig:side-by-side`) and SELF workshops, explained in
the next section.

.. figure:: side-by-side.jpg

   A side by side arrangement for effective use of Spoken Tutorials. The red
   arrow points to the video tutorial and the black arrow points to the
   software studied, in this case, Scilab. :label:`fig:side-by-side`

It is our policy that even “ordinary” people can participate in our
project, using whatever equipment they have, and get recognised and also
paid an honorarium. If an instructional tutorial is below professional
quality, but reasonably good, we accept it.
At the beginning of the project, we found that if we insisted
on professional quality, it would necessitate the use of pin drop silence
quality studios, established at a cost of millions of dollars. This
would make the cost of spoken tutorials prohibitively expensive.
Moreover, our project would become an elite one, filtering most
“ordinary” people from participating in it.

We also wanted our methodology to be beginner friendly. When we started
this work in 2009, most *Forums* that supported FOSS were quite
unfriendly to the questions posed by beginners. For example, standard
answers were,

-  First learn how to post in the forum

-  It is already answered, check the archives first

-  Read the instruction manual first before asking a question

The reasons for the response given by the experts are understandable:
there are only a few experts to answer the questions of large numbers
of beginners, many of which may be repetitive. If the experts spend
all their time in answering often repetitive questions, when will they
have time to do their own work, develop the FOSS, remove bugs, write
documents, etc., seem to be valid questions. Nevertheless, we can
confidently say that only a small fraction of FOSS exploring/loving
beginners stay with FOSS because of the above mentioned scoldings and
the lack of support structure. The system we have built is beginner
friendly, with enthusiastic participation from the experts.

When we started the project in 2009, we decided to make our project a
friendly interface between beginners and experts. One way to do this was
through a *Novice Check* of the script, before creating a video
tutorial. Unless a script is approved by a novice, it is not accepted
for recording.

We illustrate the novice check with a bash script that the author
reviewed as a beginner. The script asked the learner to download a bash
file to the current directory and to type the name of the file on the
console to execute it. On following the above instruction, the following
error message appeared: Command not found. The script writer forgot to
state that there should be a ./ (dot-slash) before the file name, as the
current directory is not in the path of beginner. After correcting this
mistake, the same error message appeared. The reason for this is that
this file is not executable. The script writer missed the following
statement: the downloaded file should be made executable by the chmod
command. These corrections were incorporated into the script before
recording it.

Thus, a spoken tutorial is recorded only after the script, created by
experts, is validated by beginners.  After recording them, we run pilot
workshops with the spoken tutorials.  If there are minor difficulties,
we mention the corrections in an instruction sheet.  If there are
major difficulties, the tutorials are re-created.

Although the details to be addressed in our tutorials seem to be excessive,
the benefits are enormous. In Table :ref:`tab:workshops`, we give the total
number of workshops that we have conducted and the number of students trained.
The methodology developed by us to achieve such large numbers is
explained in the next section.

An expert who knows that their tutorial will be watched 10,000 times
will not mind spending a lot of effort to create outstanding
instructional material. Insistence of passing through a novice check
makes beginners important and also make them feel important.  From the
expert’s point of view, once it is created, all beginners can be
directed to see the tutorial. Finally, as we discuss next, the novice
check and pilot workshops make our tutorials suitable for self learning,
which in turn has resulted in large scale training, as demonstrated in
Table :ref:`tab:workshops`.

The fact that a large number of people have undergone our LibreOffice
workshops demonstrates that we are reaching out to the clerical staff
and those who are at the doorsteps of IT literacy, and hence are at the
bottom of the pyramid.

Our efforts to reach out to beginners has resulted in a pyramid
structure: once the beginners are trained in a FOSS, they are
encouraged to create textbook companions, to be explained below.
Motivated students are then invited to participate in migrating lab
courses to FOSS, and to use FOSS to create new software systems.
Thus, bringing a large number of developers to our fold has the
beneficial effect of producing a large number of FOSS developers as
well.  We begin with our training effort.

.. _sec-spoken:

Spoken Tutorial
================

A Spoken Tutorial is an audio - video instructional material created for
self learning through the Screencast technology. When this project
started in 2009, the main objective was to create documentation for
FOSS, so that it is accessible to everyone. A detailed set of objectives
and the method followed to achieve them are summarised in [kmm14]_.

We will begin with the reasons for calling this instructional material
as a Spoken Tutorial. When this work started, there were a large number
of *silent* Screencast tutorials on the Internet. To distinguish ours
from these, we used the word *spoken*. This word is even more important,
as we dub the spoken part into all Indian languages. As we do not
capture the face of the person creating the tutorials, it is strictly
not a video tutorial. Owing to the fact that one can use Spoken Tutorial
to learn a topic, we call it a tutorial.

Spoken Tutorials have been released under a Creative Commons license and are
freely downloadable from [Spoken]_. There are about 500 original spoken
tutorials in English and more than 2,000 dubbed tutorials in various Indian
languages.

The Python Team created a set of 14 Spoken Tutorials on Python at the
beginning. On using these tutorials, it was found that the pace of some
tutorials was fast and that some topics were left out. A fresh set of 37
Spoken Tutorials have been created since then. These have also been
dubbed into a few Indian languages.

At present, we have the following Python Spoken Tutorials at the basic
level: 1) Getting started with IPython.  2) Using the plot command
interactively.  3) Embellishing a plot.  4) Saving plots. 5) Multiple
plots.  6) Additional features of IPython.  7) Loading data from
files.  8) Plotting the data.  9) Other types of plots - this helps
create scatter plot, pie and bar charts, for example.  10) Getting
started with sage notebook.  11) Getting started with symbolics.  12)
Using Sage.  13) Using sage to teach.

At the intermediate level, we have the following tutorials: 1) Getting
started with lists.  2) Getting started with for.  3) Getting started
with strings.  4) Getting started with files.  5) Parsing data.  6)
Statistics.  7) Getting started with arrays.  8) Accessing parts of
arrays.  9) Matrices.  10) Least square fit.  11) Basic data types and
operators.  12) I O.  13) Conditionals.  14) Loops.  15) Manipulating
lists.  16) Manipulating strings.  17) Getting started with tuples.
18) Dictionaries.  19) Sets.

At the advanced level, we have the following tutorials: 1) Getting
started with functions.  2) Advanced features of functions.  3) Using
Python modules.  4) Writing Python scripts.  5) Testing and debugging.

Spoken tutorials are created for self learning. The side-by-side method,
a term defined in [kmm14_]_ and illustrated in Fig. :ref:`fig:side-by-side` is recommended for the effective
use of spoken tutorials.  This is a typical screen of the student
running the tutorial.  The learner is supposed to reproduce all the
steps demonstrated in the tutorial. To achieve this, all supplementary
material required for a tutorial are provided. We illustrate this with
the Python Spoken Tutorial, loading data from files. In
Fig. :ref:`fig:st-resources`, in the command line, ``cat`` of the file ``primes.txt``
is demonstrated. By clicking the Code files link, shown with a red
arrow, one may download the required files. In the figure, we have shown
the window that pops up when the Code files link is clicked. This popped
up window asserts the availability of the file prime.txt and also other
files that are required for this tutorial. By clicking the link Video,
also at the second last line of this figure, one can download the
tutorial for offline use.

.. figure:: st-resources.jpg
   :alt: Resources available for a spoken tutorial.

   Resources available for a spoken tutorial explained with an example. The
   file used in the tutorial is available through the *Code files* link,
   indicated by an arrow. On clicking this link, the available code files are
   displayed in a new window. :label:`fig:st-resources`

As these are created for self learning, and are freely downloadable, one
should be able to learn from spoken tutorials directly from the website
[Spoken]_. Nevertheless, there are many reasons why we have been conducting
organised workshops [kmm14]_ using spoken tutorials. As these are created for
self learning, a domain expert is not required to explain the use of spoken
tutorials - a volunteer can organise these workshops. Based on trial and
error, we have decided that our workshops should be of two hour duration and
should be conducted as SELF workshops, as mentioned previously. Although these
workshops are of only two hour duration, quite a bit can be learnt in a two
hour workshop. For example, by no other method can a beginner learn LaTeX
topics, such as compilation, letter writing, report writing, mathematical
typesetting and introduction to beamer, in a two hour workshop
[kmm11-TUGboat]_. Although no domain experts may be available during these
workshops, one may get one's questions answered through a specifically
designed forum [forums]_.

Most students in India do not have access to good bandwidth and hence cannot
access our web page. As a result, we need to provide the tutorials for offline
use. In the previous paragraph, we have explained how to download a single
video. To be consistent with our ethos, we have implemented a tool that allows
the creation of an image consisting of many tutorials and downloading it for
offline use. On choosing at [Spoken]_, Software Training :math:`>` Download
Tutorials :math:`>` Create your own disk image, one reaches the page shown in
Fig. :ref:`fig:mk-image`. Through this shopping cart like facility, we can
create an image consisting of different FOSS families of spoken tutorials, in
languages of one’s choice. In this figure, one can see that the Python spoken
tutorials in English and Tamil have been selected and these will take up about
680 MB. One may add many more FOSS categories, in one or more languages to the
Selected Items list. Once all required tutorials are selected, one may click
the Submit button. The image consisting of all the tutorials will be download
as a zip file. On unzipping this file and opening the index.html file
contained therein in a web browser, such as Firefox, all the selected videos
can be played from the local drive. This zip file can be copied to all
computer systems that are meant to be used in a workshop.

.. figure:: mk-image.jpg

   clicking Software Training :math:`>` Download Tutorials :math:`>` Create
   your own disk image. See that English and Tamil versions of Python
   tutorials are selected, with a size estimate of about 680 MB.
   :label:`fig:mk-image`

The Spoken Tutorial Team helps conduct SELF workshops [events-team]_. The
workshops are offered on about 20 topics, such as Python, Scilab, C, C++,
Java, LibreOffice, LaTeX, PHP, Oscad and GNU/Linux. Organisers of SELF
workshops at different institutions download the required spoken tutorials
using the facility explained through Fig. :ref:`fig:mk-image`, install the
software to learn and ensure that the computer system, audio/video player and
the headphone are in working condition. These organised workshops create a
conducive ecosystem to learn through spoken tutorials.

As two hours may not be sufficient, one may not learn all the
tutorials during a two hour workshop.  After the workshop, the
students are encouraged to download the tutorials and to practise by
themselves at their home or office. The learners can post their
difficulties, if any, on the Spoken Tutorial Forum [forums]_ based on
the time line of a spoken tutorial. This special forum helps even
beginners to locate previous discussions relating to spoken
tutorials. An online exam is conducted a few weeks after the workshop
and the participants who pass the exam are provided with certificates.

It is possible to get details of SELF workshops conducted by our
team. In [python-ws-info]_, one can see summary details of the Python
workshops that have taken place in the state of Gujarat. One can reach
this information on [Spoken]_ by clicking the map of India, choosing
Gujarat and sorting the result by FOSS. A screenshot is given in
Fig. :ref:`fig:python-workshop-info`.  In this figure, we have shown a
red rectangle around a particular workshop that took place in Surat on
12 July 2013. By clicking the lens symbol, one can see the details of
where the workshop took place, who conducted this workshop and so
on. When the number of students who attended this workshop is shown in
red (in this case, it is 51), it means that some of them have given
their feedback. By clicking the number in red, one may locate the
feedback given by students. A typical feedback is shown in
Fig. :ref:`fig:feedback`.

We present some statistics of the people who have undergone Python
SELF workshops. The number of SELF workshops conducted until now is
417, training close to 19,000 students, with 9,300 of them being
females.  It is interesting because it is believed that generally
females do not take up programming in large numbers.  Some of the
reasons for this could be that they also find our methodology
appealing, they are equally interested in employment, etc.  Python
SELF workshops have taken place in 23 states of India. Year wise break
up of workshops is given in Table :ref:`tab:pythonWSstat`.

It should be pointed out that less than one half of the year is over in
2014.

The Python SELF workshops are effective. We have the following
testimonials:

    Through this workshop one can easily understand the basics of Python,
    which in turn can develop an interest in one’s mind to learn more about
    Python. Thank you very much for this wonderful workshop.

    -- Brindersingh - Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, West Bengal

    Got the initiative of how to work on Python that makes the programming
    comparative easy. Apart from this, graphical representation of
    mathematical formulation is quite good.

    -- Abhishek Bhargava - Institute of Engineering & Technology, Alwar

Our website [Spoken]_ is becoming popular. Fig. :ref:`fig:yr-stat`
gives details of page views on our website. One can see that the
number of page views are doubling every year. The number of people who
benefit from our work is much higher than the numbers indicated in
this figure. This is because, there are a lot of students in India who
access our material through offline mechanisms, as explained
earlier. For example, even though more than 80,000 students have
undergone SELF workshops on Linux (Table :ref:`tab:workshops`), the
largest number of server-recorded page views for any Linux video is
only about 2,500.  It seems that the equivalent number of page views
on our page is at least ten times the number indicated in
Fig. :ref:`fig:yr-stat`.

.. figure:: hist-24-june-2014.jpg

   Number of page views on [Spoken]_, since the beginning of this website. As
   there are many offline viewers in India, the effective number of page views
   may be considered to be at least twice these numbers. :label:`fig:yr-stat`

A student who is trained through a SELF workshop is ready to contribute
to the community. A textbook companion is the easiest way for them to
contribute and in the process also get rewarded. This is explained in
the next section.

.. _sec-tbc:

Textbook Companion
==================

One of the major shortcomings of FOSS tools is the lack of
documentation. Proprietary software creators can deploy a lot of money
and other resources to develop good documentation. We explain now how we
have addressed this important issue through Textbook Companions.

We wanted to create documents for FOSS using India’s abundantly
available work force, namely, students. Unfortunately, creating a
document requires a lot of experience in teaching. Students are good
in writing programs, not documents. We explored the possibility of
addressing this by solving the inverse problem: ask the students to
write programs for existing documents. Textbooks can be considered as
good documents. After doing a pilot with six students from different
parts of India in the summer of 2010, we came up with the formula of
one student, one month, one textbook companion.

Textbook companion (TBC) activity creates code for solved examples of
standard textbooks using FOSS. These are created by students and the
faculty of colleges from different parts of India. Students who create
these books are given an honorarium of Rs. 10,000 for each companion.
We were initially giving Rs. 5,000 honorarium to the teachers of these
students for review and quality assurance.  This has not worked well,
as the teachers are generally not as knowledgeable and not as serious
as the student who created the TBC.  We have now shifted the review
work to a general pool of experts, who are often students.

If anyone wants to understand what a program does, all that they have to
do is to go through the corresponding example in the associated
textbook. If TBCs are available for all textbooks used in educational
programmes, students and teachers would not need proprietary software,
at least for classroom use.

This programme is so flexible that almost anyone can contribute to the
Python Textbook Companion (PTC) activity: from students to employees,
teachers and freelancers. They can choose a textbook of their choice
from engineering, science or social sciences, the only requirement being
that Python is suitable for solving example problems. Upon
successful completion of a PTC, the participant is awarded with a
certificate and a handsome honorarium. PTCs are presented in the form of
IPython Notebooks.

The PTC interface [PTC]_ displays all the completed books together with a
screen-shot of code snippets, so that the user can easily download the PTC of
their interest. The interface also allows the users to view all the codes of a
chapter as an IPython notebook, which makes learning Python easy.

We use the following process to develop a PTC:

#. A student uploads Python code for the examples of one of the chapters
   of a chosen textbook. They should ensure that this book is not
   already completed nor under progress. They should also propose two
   other textbooks for PTC creation, in case the one they selected is
   already allocated to someone else.

#. Based on the Python code received for one chapter, our reviewers
   decide whether the student knows sufficient Python to complete the
   PTC. In case the selected textbook is already allocated to someone
   else, one of the other two chosen books is assigned. The student is
   given a time period of three months to complete the PTC.

#. The student has to upload the Python code in a specified format, on
   our portal.

#. Our reviewers check the correctness of the submitted code. They check
   whether the answers given by the code agree with those given in the
   textbooks.

#. Students who get all the code correct during the first review itself
   get a bonus, in addition to the honorarium mentioned above. Those who
   increase the work of reviewers by submitting wrong code are penalised
   and their honorarium gets reduced.

We currently have PTCs in the following categories: Fluid Mechanics,
Chemical Engineering, Thermodynamics, Mechanical Engineering, Signal
Processing, Digital Communications, Electrical Technology, Mathematics &
Pure Science, Analog Electronics, Computer Programming and others.
Currently, there are 80 completed PTCs and 80 are in progress. PTCs so
created are available for free download at [PTC]_.

The creators of PTC learn Python in a practical and effective way. One
may see below testimonials from a few of the participants:

    I experienced that even an inexperienced person can do
    coding/programming. I gradually got to advance my skills in Python
    as I approached further in it. I got the IIT-B certificate, plus I
    got paid a handsome amount of cheque after completion which was good
    enough for me at then.
    --  Amitesh Kumar

    I learnt Python from Spoken-Tutorials available on the
    website. The Python TBC team also helped me a lot in starting my
    internship. Till now, I have completed 3 TBCs and now, I know pretty
    much about python. I plan to take this project forward and Python is
    really helping me shine my resume.
    -- Deepak Shakya

    This internship provided me a perfect platform and environment to learn
    Python. It helped me to incorporate both my ideas and practical work skills
    to the best. Especially, those concepts of C which are not present in Python
    gave me an awesome experience. Moreover, experience gained from it will
    make me capable of facing and overcoming the upcoming challenges under its
    applications.
    -- Ramgopal Pandey

We would like to point out some of the processes we have followed in
the creation of PTC. Initially we tried to use the Sprint route to
create PTCs. This involved a few people jointly coding all the
problems, including unsolved problems, of a given book in one
sitting. Solving unsolved problems made the task difficult. A book
could not be completed in one session and those who coded for a part
of the textbook often did not follow up to complete the work. There
was also no ownership of the activity as many people were involved in
one book. In contrast, the Scilab group used the approach explained
previously and found it to be more effective, and more productive:
there are 377 completed Scilab TBC and 266 are in progress. As a
result, the Python group also changed the strategy for the creation of
PTCs and this has yielded good results, as explained above. We are
also in the process of contacting all who created Scilab TBC urging
them to take up the PTC work.

The FOSSEE Team at IIT Bombay [FOSSEE]_ supports the following well
known FOSS systems: Python, Scilab, OpenFOAM, COIN-OR.  It also
supports the following FOSS systems developed at IIT Bombay: Oscad (a
locally developed for Electronic Design Automation and an alternative
to OrCAD), Sandhi (an alternative to LabVIEW) and OpenFormal.  We are
in the process of creating TBCs for all of these systems.

Lab Migration
=============

Students who successfully complete textbook companions, discussed in
the previous section, are ready to help their colleges participate in
lab migration, to be explained now.

Most of the academic programmes in India have laboratory courses that
expect the students to carry out about ten experiments in a semester,
in as many lab sessions, each lasting about three hours.  Providing
FOSS code through textbook companions does not necessarily enforce its
use.  On the other hand, if a FOSS system were to be used in a lab
course, because of its compulsory nature, the use of FOSS system gets
into the main stream.  Similarly, the use of proprietary software in
lab courses perpetuates its use.  So long as a proprietary software is
used in a lab course, any number of FOSS textbook companions will not
wean the students away from the former.

The FOSSEE team helps migrate commercial software based labs to
FOSS. Once a faculty member in a college wants to migrate a lab to
FOSS, we ask them or others in our network to come up with the
required code in an equivalent FOSS and pay an honorarium. This code
is made available to the public.  Our team carries out lab migration
given in Table :ref:`tab:migration`.  The most successful of them is
Matlab to Scilab lab migration [LM]_.  We have migrated about 25 labs
from Matlab to Scilab and about 15 more are in progress.  On other
FOSS families, we have migrated only a few labs, but the interest is
growing.  Although its progress is slower than that of TBC, lab
migration can have a profound and lasting impact in promoting FOSS.

   | Commercial software | FOSS equivalent   |
   +---------------------+-------------------+
   | Matlab              | Scilab            |
   +---------------------+-------------------+
   | ORCAD               | Oscad             |

   | Quest, FlexSIM      |                   |

   | LabVIEW             | Sandhi            |
   +---------------------+-------------------+

There is an important difference between a TBC and lab migration.  The
former is for a standard textbook and its utility is of general value:
it may be of use to many students at more than one institution.  A TBC
is considered useful whether it is used or not in any one particular
college.  In contrast, the problem statements of a lab could be
specific to a particular institution.  Because of this, if the
institution that participates in lab migration does not use the FOSS
code it creates, the effort may be wasted.  We insist that lab
migration should not be just on paper, but be put in practice.
Naturally, the progress in lab migration is slower compared to the TBC
effort.

Completing the Pyramid Structure
================================

In this section, we explain how our FOSS efforts help result in a
pyramid structure of trained students.  We started with SELF workshop
based training, progressed to TBC and then reached lab migration, with
each stage having increased complexity, as explained in the previous
sections.  In this section, we explain how a few other higher level
activities that we have undertaken help result in a pyramid structure.

The next complicated task we have recently undertaken is to help our
students do full projects using the FOSS that we support. Here is a
feedback from a student who completed his Master’s thesis using Oscad:

    With intensive cooperation and guidance on Oscad EDA tool, from all
    of You, I have completed the project on “Design and Performance
    Analysis of OTA based SNR Meter” successfully and also submitted the
    project report today. Sincere thanks to all of You. Oscad is really
    user friendly and also highly accurate which is the main reason for
    completion of the project so smoothly.

    We at Mangalore Institute of Technology and Engineering have
    decided to use Oscad for two of the labs “Linear Integrated Circuits
    and Analog communication” and “Power Electronics” labs. Your support
    is very much needed mainly for power electronics lab. Hope you will
    provide it. Thanks a lot.
    -- Harish Bhat

The next task is to help improve the FOSS itself or to use the FOSS to create
new software. Typically, existing FOSS tools are used to create new FOSS
systems. Python turns out to be an excellent glue language. We have used
Python extensively in the creation of Oscad [oscad-book]_, [oscad-lj]_. We are
using Python extensively, once again, in the creation of Sandhi, a FOSS
alternative to LabVIEW. Sandhi is yet to be released to the public. We have
been using Python also to create online evaluation software to administer post
SELF workshop tests.

The next level in this progression is possibly entrepreneurship.  It
is next level, because, an entrepreneurship is a lot more difficult
compared to being a programmer.  We also hope that the entrepreneurs
who would come out of our work would be good in programming at the
minimum.  We are exploring the feasibility of grooming potential
entrepreneurs from the students whom we train.  At present we train
about 200,000 students a year through SELF workshops. We expect about
1% of them to be good, possibly as a result of our FOSS promotion
efforts. If 10% of this 1% are interested in becoming entrepreneurs, we
will have about 200 people to train. Initial enquiries convince us
that many groups that want to promote entrepreneurship may be
interested in working with our selection.  We believe that we can
generate an army of entrepreneurs.  If we succeed in this endeavour, we
would really have achieved a pyramid structure.

The benefits of our effort are also in a pyramid structure. At the
lowest level, the learners get IT literacy. At the next level, we have
students passing exams, because of our training material, see a
testimonial:

    In my college, one of the students in btech 3rd year 1st sem was
    having a makeup exam and and he was looking for guidance in learning
    Java. We gave the spoken-tutorial CD material on Java, and gave
    explanation on the contents of the CD. After the exam he came and
    told that the spoken tutorial CD on java helped him a lot and that
    he developed confidence in Java by going thru all the tutorials and
    doing the assignments. He also told that the video tutorials cleared
    most of his doubts on java and helped him in passing the makeup
    exam.
    -- Prof. K. V. Nagarjuna, Sree Dattha Inst. of Engg. and Science

Then, there are several levels of employment, starting from routine IT
work, all the way up to work in niche areas, with attractive salaries.
Finally, there is a possibility of one starting one’s own company.

Aakash: World’s lowest cost computing device
============================================

The agency that funded our FOSS promotion projects has created several
e-content resources. It has also provided large amounts of bandwidth to
educational institutions. These two do not get utilised effectively if
the students do not have an affordable access device. If a student does
not have an access device, they cannot participate in some of our
projects. This affects their learning, while simultaneously resulting in
loss of possible honorarium income. Aakash is the result of our efforts
to address this problem [mpsv13]_, [sp13]_.

Aakash has indeed become a convergence device for our projects. Spoken
Tutorials can be played on Aakash, see Fig. :ref:`fig:spoken-aakash`.
A PTC running on Aakash is shown in Fig. :ref:`fig:aakash-portrait`.

Conclusions and Future Work
===========================

This article has summarised how the FOSS promotion work we started in
2009 has evolved into a massive training programme that caters to the
bottom of the pyramid and also to those at the top. Given that our
approach has worked for IT skills development, we are exploring the
possibility of replicating this method to other skills development
areas as well. It will be great if we can succeed in this, as India
has a big shortage of skilled personnel and a large number of youngsters
who want employment. The training may have to start at school level
and this is an order of magnitude larger problem. Finally, all our
material and processes are in the open and are available to FOSS
enthusiasts all over the world.
