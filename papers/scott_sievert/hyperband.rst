Faster and better model selection with Dask
-------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   TODO

.. class:: keywords

   machine learning, model selection, dask

Introduction
------------

.. Introduction
   Hyperparameters are input to machine learning workflow
   They require tuning
   For modern classifier: Difficult problem (continuous variables, deep learning, etc)

.. Problem statement
   Question 1: how good?
   Question 2: how fast?
   Question 3: inputs to selection?

.. Contributions
   A high performing algorithm, Hyperband, is implemented in Dask-ML
   * Has mathematical justification; specifically it performs well with high probability
   * Amendable to parallelism
   * Easy to use
   These provide progress towards all 3 questions above.
   We will walk through each of these sections.

.. Theoretical groundings
   Thm from Hyperband paper
   Depends on successive halving
   Runs many brackets in parallel
   Intuition: use bandit framework

.. Amendable to parallelism
   Two levels of parallelism
   Intuition: requires sweeping over how easy to use

.. Ease of use
   Requires one parameter
   Direct result of killing off models early and sweeping over parameter
   Here's how to specify

.. Simulations
   Walk through blog post example

.. Conclusion & Future work
   Conclusion
   Implement for black-box models
   Work on removing deepcopy
   Validate works well with large memory GPU models


There are three inputs to a machine learning pipeline: data, an untrained model
and values that influence the training and performance of the model, a.k.a.
"hyper-parameters". At the most basic level, these hyper-parameters help adapt
the model to the data. For example, the model might have one hyper-parameter
that adapts the prediction to the amount of noise present in the data
(e.g., :cite:`TODO`).

These hyper-parameters are typically assumed to be known.

Model performance strongly depends on which hyper-parameters are given as
input. In practice, the hyper-parameters are not known. This requires doing a
search over different values or combinations of hyper-parameters, a.k.a. "model
selection".

Model selection has become more complicated as data has grown, especially with
the growth of deep learning.

Model selection is required if high performance is desired. In practice, it's a
burden for machine learning researchers and practitioners. Personal experience
suggests that model selection should

1. **produce high performing models.**
2. **finish quickly.**
3. **be easy to use** by requiring minimal inputs. Ideally, inputs to the model
   selection algorithm wouldn't require careful thought or tuning.


Bibliographies, citations and block quotes
------------------------------------------

If you want to include a ``.bib`` file, do so above by placing  :code:`:bibliography: yourFilenameWithoutExtension` as above (replacing ``mybib``) for a file named :code:`yourFilenameWithoutExtension.bib` after removing the ``.bib`` extension.

**Do not include any special characters that need to be escaped or any spaces in the bib-file's name**. Doing so makes bibTeX cranky, & the rst to LaTeX+bibTeX transform won't work.

To reference citations contained in that bibliography use the :code:`:cite:`citation-key`` role, as in :cite:`hume48` (which literally is :code:`:cite:`hume48`` in accordance with the ``hume48`` cite-key in the associated ``mybib.bib`` file).

However, if you use a bibtex file, this will overwrite any manually written references.

So what would previously have registered as a in text reference ``[Atr03]_`` for

::

     [Atr03] P. Atreides. *How to catch a sandworm*,
           Transactions on Terraforming, 21(3):261-300, August 2003.

what you actually see will be an empty reference rendered as **[?]**.

E.g., [Atr03]_.


If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in

    When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication. :cite:`hume48`

Dois in bibliographies
++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to include a doi in your bibliography, add the doi to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
   }


If there are errors when adding it due to non-alphanumeric characters, see if
wrapping the doi in ``\detokenize`` works to solve the issue.

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = \detokenize{10.1017/CBO9780511808432},
   }

Source code examples
--------------------

Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }

Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +============+================+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Difference & 5,911.3 & 7,424.1 & 27.2\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Percent Difference & 44\% & 41\% & 43\%\tabularnewline
     \hline
     \end{longtable*}

     \caption{Area Comparisons \DUrole{label}{quanitities-table}}

   \end{table*}

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse [#]_:
