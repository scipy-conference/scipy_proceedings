abstract:
   - A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a short version anyway. Still, when considering the facts from first principles, we find that the outcomes of this introspective approach is compatible with the guidelines previously established.
   - In such an experiment it is then clear that the potential for further development not only depends on previous relationships found but also on connections made during exploitation of this novel new experimental protocol.
