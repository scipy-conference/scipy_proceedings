title: A Numerical Perspective to Terraforming a Desert
abstract: |
  A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a
  short version anyway.  Still, when considering the facts from first
  principles, we find that the outcomes of this introspective approach is
  compatible with the guidelines previously established.

  In such an experiment it is then clear that the potential for further
  development not only depends on previous relationships found but also on
  connections made during exploitation of this novel new experimental
  protocol.

## Introduction

Twelve hundred years ago â€” in a galaxy just across the hill...

This document should be rendered with MyST Markdown [mystmd.org](https://mystmd.org),
which is a markdown variant inspired by reStructuredText. This uses the `mystmd`
CLI for scientific writing which can be [downloaded here](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart).
When you have installed `mystmd`, run `myst start` in this folder and
follow the link for a live preview, any changes to this file will be
reflected immediately.

## Bibliographies, citations and block quotes

Bibliography files and DOIs are automatically included and picked up by `mystmd`.
These can be added using pandoc-style citations `[@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55]`
which fetches the citation information automatically and creates: [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55].
Additionally, you can use any key in the BibTeX file using `[@citation-key]`,
as in [@hume48] (which literally is `[@hume48]` in accordance with
the `hume48` cite-key in the associated `mybib.bib` file).
Read more about [citations in the MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/citations).

If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in:

> When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.

### DOIs in bibliographies

In order to include a DOI in your bibliography, add the DOI to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 7
:linenos:
@book{hume48,
  author    =  "David Hume",
  year      = {1748},
  title     = "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
  address   = "Indianapolis, IN",
  publisher = "Hackett",
  doi       = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
}
```

### Citing software and websites

Any paper relying on open-source software would surely want to include citations.
Often you can find a citation in BibTeX format via a web search.
Authors of software packages may even publish guidelines on how to cite their work.

For convenience, citations to common packages such as
Jupyter [@jupyter],
Matplotlib [@matplotlib],
NumPy [@numpy],
pandas [@pandas1; @pandas2],
scikit-learn [@sklearn1; @sklearn2], and
SciPy [@scipy]
are included in this paper's `.bib` file.

In this paper we not only terraform a desert using the package terradesert [@terradesert], we also catch a sandworm with it.
To cite a website, the following BibTeX format plus any additional tags necessary for specifying the referenced content is recommended.
If you are citing a team, ensure that the author name is wrapped in additional braces `{Team Name}`, so it is not treated as an authors first and last names.

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 2
:linenos:
@misc{terradesert,
  author = {{TerraDesert Team}},
  title = {Code for terraforming a desert},
  year = {2000},
  url = {https://terradesert.com/code/},
  note = {Accessed 1 Jan. 2000}
}
```

## Source code examples

No paper would be complete without some source code.
Code highlighting is completed if the name is given:

```python
def sum(a, b):
    """Sum two numbers."""

    return a + b
```

Use the `{code-block}` directive if you are getting fancy with line numbers or emphasis. For example, line-numbers in `C` looks like:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number, and emphasizing a line:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true
:lineno-start: 2
:emphasize-lines: 3
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
```

You can read more about code formatting in the [MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/code).

## Figures, Equations and Tables

It is well known that Spice grows on the planet Dune [@Atr03].
Test some maths, for example $e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta$.
Or maybe an equation on a separate line:

```{math}
g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx
```

or on multiple, aligned lines:

```{math}
\begin{aligned}
g(x) &= \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
     &= \ldots
\end{aligned}
```

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

```{math}
:label: circarea

A(r) = \pi r^2.
```

```{math}
:label: spherevol

V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
```

We can then refer back to Equation {ref}`circarea` or
{ref}`spherevol` later.
The `{ref}` role is another way to cross-reference in your document, which may be familiar to users of Sphinx.

:::{figure} figure1.png
:label: fig:stream
This is the caption, sandworm vorticity based on storm location in a pleasing stream plot. Based on example in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/arrays/streamplot.html).
:::

:::{figure} figure2.png
:label: fig:em
This is the caption, electromagnetic signature of the sandworm based on remote sensing techniques. Based on example in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/stats/hist2d.html).
:::

As you can see in @fig:stream and @fig:em, this is how you reference auto-numbered figures.
To refer to a sub figure use the syntax `@label [a]` in text or `[@label a]` for a parenhetical citation (i.e. @fig:stream [a] vs [@fig:stream a]).
For even more control, you can simply link to figures using `[Figure %s](#label)`, the `%s` will get filled in with the number, for example [Figure %s](#fig:stream).
See complete documentation on [cross-references](https://mystmd.org/guide/cross-references).

```{list-table} This is the caption for the materials table.
:label: tbl:materials
:header-rows: 1
* - Material
  - Units
* - Stone
  - 3
* - Water
  - 12
* - Cement
  - {math}`\alpha`
```

We show the different quantities of materials required in
@tbl:materials.

Unfortunately, markdown can be difficult for defining tables, so if your table is more complex you can try embedding HTML:

:::{table} Area Comparisons (written in html)
:label: tbl:areas-html

<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Projection</th><th colspan="3" align="center">Area in square miles</th></tr>
<tr><th align="right">Large Horizontal Area</th><th align="right">Large Vertical Area</th><th align="right">Smaller Square Area<th></tr>
<tr><td>Albers Equal Area   </td><td align="right"> 7,498.7   </td><td align="right"> 10,847.3  </td><td align="right">35.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Web Mercator        </td><td align="right"> 13,410.0  </td><td align="right"> 18,271.4  </td><td align="right">63.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Difference          </td><td align="right"> 5,911.3   </td><td align="right"> 7,424.1   </td><td align="right">27.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Percent Difference  </td><td align="right"> 44%       </td><td align="right"> 41%       </td><td align="right">43%</td></tr>
</table>
:::

or if you prefer LaTeX you can try `tabular` or `longtable` environments:

```{raw} latex
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{\bf Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\bf Area in square miles} \\
  \cline{2-4}
   & \textbf{Large Horizontal Area} & \textbf{Large Vertical Area} & \textbf{Smaller Square Area} \\
  \hline
  Albers Equal Area   & 7,498.7   & 10,847.3  & 35.8  \\
  Web Mercator        & 13,410.0  & 18,271.4  & 63.0  \\
  Difference          & 5,911.3   & 7,424.1   & 27.2  \\
  Percent Difference  & 44\%      & 41\%      & 43\%  \\
  \hline
  \end{longtable*}

  \caption{Area Comparisons (written in LaTeX) \label{tbl:areas-tex}}
\end{table*}
```

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse[^footnote-3]:

> Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.

[^footnote-3]: $\mathrm{e^{-i\pi}}$
