  title: Model Share AI
  subtitle: An Integrated Toolkit for Collaborative Machine Learning Model Development, Provenance Tracking, and Deployment in Python
  description: Machine learning is revolutionizing a wide range of research areas and industries, but many ML projects never progress past the proof-of-concept stage. To address this problem, we introduce Model Share AI, a platform designed to streamline collaborative model development, model provenance tracking, and model deployment.
