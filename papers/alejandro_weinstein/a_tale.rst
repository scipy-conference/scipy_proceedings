.. class:: abstract 

This work describes the use some scientific Python tools to solve information
gathering problems using Reinforcement Learning. In particular, we focus on the
problem of designing an agent able to learn how to gather information in linked
datasets. We use four different libraries |---| RL-Glue, Gensim, NetworkX, and
scikit-learn |---| during different stages of our research. We show that, by
using NumPy arrays as the default vector/matrix format, it is possible to
integrate these libraries with minimal effort.

Introduction
------------

In addition to bringing efficient array computing and standard mathematical
tools to Python, the NumPy/SciPy libraries provide an ecosystem where multiple
libraries can coexist and interact. This work describes a success story where
we integrate several libraries, developed by different groups, to solve some of
our research problems.

Our research focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to gather information
in domains described by an underlying linked dataset. For instance, we are
interested in problems such as the following: given a Wikipedia article as a
seed, finding other articles that are interesting relative to the starting
point. Of particular interest is to find articles that are more than one-click
away from the seed, since these articles are in general harder to find by a
human.

In addition to the staples of scientific Python computing NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and IPython, we use the libraries RL-Glue [Tan09]_, NetworkX
[Hag08]_, Gensim [Reh10]_, and scikit-learn [Ped11]_.

Reinforcement Learning considers the interaction between a given environment
and an agent. The objective is to design an agent able to learn a policy that
allows it to maximize its total expected reward. We use the RL-Glue library for
our RL experiments. This library provides the infrastructure to connect an
environment and an agent, each one described by an independent Python program.

We represent the linked datasets we work with as graphs. For this we use
NetworkX, which provides data structures to efficiently represent graphs,
together with implementations of many classic graph algorithms. We use NetworkX
graphs to describe the environments implemented using RL-Glue. We also use
these graphs to create, analyze and visualize graphs built from unstructured
data.

One of the contributions of our research is the idea of representing the items
in the datasets as vectors belonging to a linear space. To this end, we build a
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [Dee90]_ model to project documents onto a
vector space. This allows us, in addition to being able to compute similarities
between documents, to leverage a variety of RL techniques that require a vector
representation. We use the Gensim library to build the LSA model. This library
provides all the machinery to build, among other options, the LSA model. One
place where Gensim shines is in its capability to handle big data sets, like
the entire Wikipedia, that do not fit in memory. We also combine the vector
representation of the items as a property of the NetworkX nodes.

Finally, we also use the manifold learning capabilities of sckit-learn, like
the ISOMAP algorithm [Ten00]_, to perform some exploratory data analysis. By
reducing the dimensionality of the LSA vectors obtained using Gensim from 400
to 3, we are able to visualize the relative position of the vectors together
with their connections.

Reinforcement Learning
------------------------------------------------------------

The RL paradigm [Sut98]_ considers an agent that interacts with an environment
described by a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Formally, an MDP is defined by a
state space :math:`\mathcal{X}`, an action space :math:`\mathcal{A}`, a
transition probability function :math:`P`, and a reward function :math:`r`. At
a given sample time :math:`t=0,1,\ldots` the agent is at state :math:`x_t \in
\mathcal{X}`, and it chooses action :math:`a_t \in \mathcal{A}`. Given the
current state :math:`x` and selected action :math:`a`, the probability that the
next state is :math:`x'` is determined by :math:`P(x,a,x')`. After reaching the
next state :math:`x'`, the agent observes an immediate reward
:math:`r(x')`. Figure :ref:`figRL` depicts the agent-environment
interaction. In an RL problem, the objective is to find a function
:math:`\pi:\mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{A}`, called the *policy*, that
maximizes the total expected reward

.. math::

   R = \mathbf{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^\infty \gamma^t r(x_t) \right],

where :math:`\gamma \in (0,1)` is a given discount factor. Note that typically
the agent does not know the functions :math:`P` and :math:`r`, and it must find
the optimal policy by interacting with the environment. See ﻿Szepesvári [Sze10]_
for a detailed review of the theory of MDPs and the different algorithms used
in RL.

.. figure:: RL_scheme.pdf

   The agent-environment interaction. The agent observes the current state
   :math:`x` and reward :math:`r`; then it executes action
   :math:`\pi(x)=a`. :label:`figRL`

We implement the RL algorithms using the RL-Glue library [Tan09]_. The library
consists of the *RL-Glue Core* program and a set of codecs for different
languages [#]_ to communicate with the library. To run an instance of a RL
problem one needs to write three different programs: the *environment*, the
*agent*, and the *experiment*. The environment and the agent programs match
exactly the corresponding elements of the RL framework, while the experiment
orchestrates the interaction between these two. The following code snippets
show the main methods that these three programs must implement:

.. code-block:: python

   ################# environment.py #################
   class env(Environment):
       def env_start(self):
           # Set the current state

           return current_state

       def env_step(self, action):
           # Set the new state according to 
           # the current state and given action.

           return reward 

    #################### agent.py ####################
    class agent(Agent):
        def agent_start(self, state):
            # First step of an experiment
            
            return action
            
        def agent_step(self, reward, obs):
            # Execute a step of the RL algorithm
            
            return action

    ################# experiment.py ##################
    RLGlue.init()
    RLGlue.RL_start() 
    RLGlue.RL_episode(100) # Run an episode

    

Note that RL-Glue is only a thin layer among these programs, allowing us to use
any construction inside them. In particular, as described in the following
sections, we use a NetworkX graph to model the environment.


.. [#] Currently there are codecs for Python, C/C++, Java, Lisp, MATLAB, and
       Go.


Computing the Similarity between Documents
------------------------------------------

To be able to gather information, we need to be able to quantify how relevant
an item in the dataset is. When we work with documents, we use the similarity
between a given document and the seed to this end. Among the several ways of
computing similarities between documents, we choose the Vector Space Model
[Man08]_. Under this setup, each document is represented by a vector. The
similarity between two documents is estimated by the *cosine similarity* of the
document vector representations.

The first step in representing a piece of text as a vector is to build a *bag
of words* model, where we count the occurrences of each term in the
document. These word frequencies become the vector entries, and we denote the
*term frequency* of term :math:`t` in document :math:`d` by
:math:`\operatorname{tf}_{t,d}`. Although this model ignores information
related to the order of the words, it is still powerful enough to produce
meaningful results.

In the context of a collection of documents, or corpus, word frequency is not
enough to asses the importance of a term. For this reason, we introduce the
quantity *document frequency* :math:`\operatorname{df}_t`, defined to be the
number of documents in the collection that contain term :math:`t`. We can now
define the *inverse document frequency* (:math:`\operatorname{idf}`) as

.. math::

   \operatorname{idf}_t = \log \frac{N}{\operatorname{df}_t},

where :math:`N` is the number of documents in the corpus. The
:math:`\operatorname{idf}` is a measure of how unusual a term is. We define the
:math:`\operatorname{tf-idf}` weight of term :math:`t` in document :math:`d` as

.. math::

   \operatorname{tf-idf}_{t,d} = \operatorname{tf}_{t,d} \times
   \operatorname{idf}_t.

This quantity is a good indicator of the discriminating power of a term inside
a given document. For each document in the corpus we compute a vector of length
:math:`M`, where :math:`M` is the total number of terms in the corpus. Each
entry of this vector is the :math:`\operatorname{tf-idf}` weight for each term
(if a term does not exist in the document, the weight is set to 0). We stack
all the vectors to build the :math:`M\times N` *term-document matrix*
:math:`C`.

Note that since typically a document contains only a small fraction of the
total number of terms in the corpus, the columns of the term-document matrix
are sparse. The method known as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [Dee90]_
constructs a low-rank approximation :math:`C_k` of rank at most :math:`k` of
:math:`C`. The value of :math:`k`, also known as the *latent dimension*, is a
design parameter typically chosen to be in the low hundreds. This low-rank
representation induces a projection onto a :math:`k`-dimensional space. The
similarity between the vector representation of the documents is now computed
after projecting the vectors onto this subspace. One advantage of LSA is that
it deals with the problems of *synonymy*, where different words have the same
meaning, and *polysemy*, where one word has different meanings.

Using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the term-document matrix
:math:`C=U\Sigma V^T`, the :math:`k`-rank approximation of :math:`C` is given
by

.. math::

   C_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T,

where :math:`U_k`, :math:`\Sigma_k`, and :math:`V_k` are the matrices formed by
the :math:`k` first columns of :math:`U`, :math:`\Sigma`, and :math:`V`,
respectively. The :math:`\operatorname{tf-idf}` representation of a document
:math:`q` is projected onto the :math:`k`-dimensional subspace as

.. math::

   q_k = \Sigma_k^{-1} U_k^Tq.

Note that this projection transforms a sparse vector of length :math:`M` into a
dense vector of length :math:`k`.

In this work we use the *Gensim* library [Reh10]_ to build the vector space
model. To test the library we downloaded the top 100 most popular books from
project Gutenberg. [#]_ After constructing the LSA model with 200 latent
dimensions, we computed the similarity between *Moby Dick*, which is in the
corpus used to build the model, and 6 other documents (see the results in Table
:ref:`tblSim`). The first document is an excerpt from *Moby Dick*, 393 words
long. The second one is an excerpt from the Wikipedia *Moby Dick* article. The
third one is an excerpt, 185 words long, of *The Call of the Wild*. The
remaining two documents are excerpts from Wikipedia articles not related to
*Moby Dick*. The similarity values we obtain validate the model, since we can
see high values (above 0.8) for the documents related to *Moby Dick*, and
significantly smaller values for the remaining ones.

Next, we build the LSA model for Wikipedia that allows us to compute the
similarity between Wikipedia articles. Although this is a lengthy process that
takes more than 20 hours, once the model is built, a similarity computation is
very fast (on the order of 10 milliseconds). The results in next section make
use of this model.

Note that although in principle it is simple to compute the LSA model of a
given corpus, the size of the datasets we are interested in make doing this a
significant challenge. The two main difficulties are that in general (i) we
cannot hold the vector representation of the corpus in RAM memory, and (ii) we
need to compute the SVD of a matrix whose size is beyond the limits of what
standard solvers can handle. Here Gensim does stellar work by being able to
handle both these challenges.


Representing the State Space as a Graph
---------------------------------------

We are interested in the problem of gathering information in domains described
by linked datasets. It is natural to describe such domains by graphs. We use
the NetworkX library [Hag08]_ to build the graphs we work with. NetworkX
provides data structures to represents different kinds of graphs (undirected,
weighted, directed, etc.), together with implementations of many graph
algorithms. NetworkX allows one to use any hashable Python object as a node
identifier. Also, any Python object can be used as a node, edge, or graph
attribute. We exploit this capability by using the LSA vector representation of
a Wikipedia article, which is a NumPy array, as a node attribute.

The following code snippet shows a function [#]_ used to build a directed graph
where nodes represent Wikipedia articles, and the edges represent links between
articles. Note that we compute the LSA representation of the article (line 11),
and that this vector is used as a node attribute (line 13). The function
obtains up to ``n_max`` articles by breath-first crawling the Wikipedia,
starting from the article defined by ``page``.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    def crawl(page, n_max):
        G = nx.DiGraph()
        n = 0
        links = [(page, -1, None)]
        while n < n_max:
            link = links.pop()
            page = link[0]
            dist = link[1] + 1
            page_text = page.edit().encode('utf-8')
            # LSI representation of page_text
            v_lsi = get_lsi(page_text)
            # Add node to the graph
            G.add_node(page.name, v=v_lsi)
            if link[2]:
                source = link[2]
                dest = page.name
                if G.has_edge(source, dest):
                    # Link already exists
                    continue
                else:
                    sim = get_similarity(page_text)
                    self.G.add_edge(source,
                                    dest,
                                    weight=sim,
                                    d=dist)
            new_links = [(l, dist, page.name) 
                         for l in page.links()]
            links = new_links + links
            n += 1

        return G

.. [#] The parameter ``page`` is a mwclient page object. See
       http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mwclient/.

We now show the result of running the code above for two different setups. In
the first instance we crawl the *Simple English Wikipedia* [#]_ using "Army" as
the seed article. We set the limit on the number of articles to visit
to 100. The result is depicted [#]_ in Fig. :ref:`figArmy`, where the node
corresponding to the seed article is in light blue and the remaining nodes have
a size proportional to the similarity with respect to the seed. Red nodes are
the ones with similarity bigger than 0.5. We observe two nodes, "Defense" and
"Weapon", with similarities 0.7 and 0.53 respectively, that are three links
ahead of the seed.

.. [#] To generate this figure, we save the NetworkX graph in GEXF format, and
       create the diagram using Gephi (http://gephi.org/).

In the second instance we crawl Wikipedia using the article "James Gleick" [#]_
as seed. We set the limit on the number of articles to visit to 2000. We show
the result in Fig. :ref:`figGleick`, where, as in the previous example, the
node corresponding to the seed is in light blue and the remaining nodes have a
size proportional to the similarity with respect to the seed. The eleven red
nodes are the ones with similarity bigger than 0.7. Of these, 9 are more than
one link ahead of the seed. We see that the article with the biggest
similarity, with a value of 0.8, is about "Robert Wright (journalist)", and it
is two links ahead from the seed (passing through the "Slate magazine"
article). Robert Wright writes books about sciences, history and religion. It
is very reasonable to consider him an author similar to James Gleick. 


.. [#] The Simple English Wikipedia (http://simple.wikipedia.org) has articles
       written in *simple English* and has a much smaller number of articles
       than the standard Wikipedia. We use it because of its simplicity.

.. [#] James Gleick is "an American author, journalist, and biographer, whose
    books explore the cultural ramifications of science and technology".

.. figure:: army.pdf 

   Graph for the "Army" article in the simple Wikipedia with 97 nodes and 99
   edges. The seed article is in light blue. The size of the nodes (except for
   the seed node) is proportional to the similarity. In red are all the nodes
   with similarity bigger than 0.5. We found two articles ("Defense" and
   "Weapon") similar to the seed three links ahead. :label:`figArmy`

.. figure:: gleick.pdf
   
   Graph for the "James Gleick" Wikipedia article with 1975 nodes and 1999
   edges. The seed article is in light blue. The size of the nodes (except for
   the seed node) is proportional to the similarity. In red are all the nodes
   with similarity bigger than 0.7. There are several articles with high
   similarity more than one link ahead. :label:`figGleick`
            

Another place where graphs can play an important role in the RL problem is when
we want to find basis functions to approximate the value-function. The
value-function is the function :math:`V^\pi: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathbb{R}`
defined as

.. math::

   V^\pi (x) = \mathbf{E}\left[\sum_{t=1}^\infty \gamma^t r(x_t) \bigm\vert 
   x_0 = x, a_t = \pi(x_t) \right],

and plays a key role in many RL algorithms [Sze10]_. When the dimension of
:math:`\mathcal{X}` is significant, it is common to approximate :math:`V^\pi
(x)` by

.. math::
   
   V^\pi \approx \hat{V} = \Phi w,

where :math:`\Phi` is an :math:`n`-by-:math:`k` matrix whose columns are the
basis functions used to approximate the value-function, :math:`n` is the number
of states, and :math:`w` is a vector of dimension :math:`k`. Typically, the
basis functions are selected by hand, for example, by using polynomials or
radial basis functions. Since choosing the right functions can be difficult,
Mahadevan and Maggioni [Mah07]_ proposed a framework where these basis
functions are learned from the topology of the state space. The key idea is to
represent the state space by a graph and use the :math:`k` smoothest
eigenvectors of the graph laplacian, dubbed *Proto-value* functions, as basis
functions. Given the graph that represents the state space, it is very simple
to find these basis functions. As an example, consider an environment
consisting of three :math:`16\times 20` grid-like rooms connected in the
middle, as shown in Fig. :ref:`figRooms`. Assuming the graph is stored in
``G``, the following code [#]_ computes the eigenvectors of the laplacian::

    L = nx.laplacian(G, sorted(G.nodes()))
    evalues, evec = np.linalg.eigh(L)

Figure :ref:`figRoomsEv` shows [#]_ the second to fourth eigenvectors. Since in
general value-functions associated to this environment will exhibit a fast
change rate close to the room's boundaries, these eigenvectors provide an
efficient approximation basis.

.. figure:: three_rooms_graph.pdf

   Environment described by three :math:`16 \times 20` rooms connected through
   the middle row. :label:`figRooms`

.. figure:: three_rooms_eigvec.pdf

   Second to fourth eigenvectors of the laplacian of the three rooms
   graph. Note how the eigendecomposition automatically captures the structure
   of the environment. :label:`figRoomsEv`

.. [#] We assume that the standard ``import numpy as np`` and ``import networkx
       as nx`` statements were previously executed.

.. [#] The eigenvectors are reshaped from vectors of dimension :math:`3 \times
       16 \times 20 = 960` to a matrix of size 16-by-60. To get meaningful
       results, it is necessary to build the laplacian using the nodes in the
       grid in a row major order. This is why the ``nx.laplacian`` function is
       called with ``sorted(G.nodes())`` as the second parameter.

Visualizing the LSA Space
-------------------------

We believe that being able to work in a vector space will allow us to use a
series of RL techniques that otherwise we would not be available to use. For
example, when using Proto-value functions, it is possible to use the Nyström
approximation to estimate the value of an eigenvector for out-of-sample states
[Mah06]_; this is only possible if states can be represented as points
belonging to a Euclidean space.

How can we embed an entity in Euclidean space? In the previous section we
showed that LSA can effectively compute the similarity between documents. We
can take this concept one step forward and use LSA not only for computing
similarities, but also for embedding documents in Euclidean space.

To evaluate the soundness of this idea, we perform an exploratory analysis of
the simple Wikipedia LSA space. In order to be able to visualize the vectors,
we use ISOMAP [Ten00]_ to reduce the dimension of the LSA vectors from 200 to 3
(we use the ISOMAP implementation provided by scikit-learn [Ped11]_). We show a
typical result in Fig. :ref:`figISOMAP`, where each point represents the LSA
embedding of an article in :math:`\mathbb{R}^3`, and a line between two points
represents a link between two articles. We can see how the points close to the
"Water" article are, in effect, semantically related ("Fresh water", "Lake",
"Snow", etc.). This result confirms that the LSA representation is not only
useful for computing similarities between documents, but it is also an
effective mechanism for embedding the information entities into a Euclidean
space. This result encourages us to propose the use of the LSA representation
in the definition of the state.

Once again we emphasize that since Gensim vectors are NumPY arrays, we can use
its output as an input to scikit-learn without any effort.

.. figure:: isomap_lsa.pdf

   ISOMAP projection of the LSA space. Each point represents the LSA vector of
   a Simple English Wikipedia article projected onto :math:`\mathbb{R}^3` using
   ISOMAP. A line is added if there is a link between the corresponding
   articles. The figure shows a close-up around the "Water" article. We can
   observe that this point is close to points associated to articles with a
   similar semantic. :label:`figISOMAP`
 


Conclusions
-----------

We have presented an example where we use different elements of the scientific
Python ecosystem to solve a research problem. Since we use libraries where
NumPy arrays are used as the default vector/matrix format, the integration
among these components is transparent. We believe that this work is a good
success story that validates Python as a viable scientific programming
language.

Our work shows that in many cases it is advantageous to use general purposes
languages, like Python, for scientific computing. Although some computational
parts of this work might be somewhat simpler to implement in a domain specific
language, [#]_ the breath of tasks that we work with could make it hard to
integrate all of the parts using a domain specific language.

.. [#] Examples of such languages are MATLAB, Octave, SciLab, etc.
