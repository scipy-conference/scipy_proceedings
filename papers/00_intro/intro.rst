SciPy 2014, the thirteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python
conference, was held July 6 |--| 12th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a
community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through
open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

The SciPy conferences have become a prominent forum for Python users
from the academic, commercial and government sectors to present and
develop their latest tools and innovations.  Topics cover a wide array
of domains, from cross-language interactions to education and
cutting-edge research. These events, by virtue of embracing both
in-depth scientific exploration and programming/code, form a unique
connection between the academic and developer communities. At SciPy,
code, science, and math live on the same screen.

It is an exciting time to be part of this community that has spent the
last decade developing sophisticated tools |---| tools that are now ideally
suited to address technical problems arising at the blooming
intersection of specialized domains and computation. Many contributors
to the community have been hired at university data institutions,
Python has become the number one language for undergraduate teaching,
and many productive partnerships have been formed with industry.

The conference continues to grow with almost 500 participants from
across the globe. More than half of attendees are now from industry,
the rest split between government laboratories and the academy.  The
organizing committee is committed to increasing representation from
underrepresented groups.  This year, 15% of attendees were women, a
significant increase from 3% in 2013. A Diversity Committee was formed
to ensure that this trend continues.

Geospatial Computing and Education were central themes this year, with
additional minisymposia on the following topics:

- Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Bioinformatics
- Geophysics
- Vision, Visualization, and Imaging
- Computational Social Science and Digital Humanities
- Engineering

|noindent|
Birds of a Feather sessions were organized around select solicited
topics, providing an effective platform for discussing issues relevant
to the community.  New open space activities, sponsor funded social
events and tutorials effectively exposed newcomers to the welcoming
and inclusive scientific Python community.

We were privileged to have three prominent community members present
keynotes. Greg Wilson gave a heart-felt call for action, encouraging
the enhancement of tools for education in scientific computing. Lorena
Barba focused on the interactions between computation, the system
under study and learning, highlighting the importance of tools that
facilitate those connections.  The final keynote speaker, Python core
developer Nick Coghlan, presented his perspective on the distribution
of open source tools, emphasizing the need to bridge gaps that exist
between various channels of distribution.

These proceedings contain 16 peer-reviewed contributions, based on
talks presented at the conference.  They provide a peek into the
current state of the ever-evolving landscape of Python in Science.  We
hope you find pleasure in the effort the authors have made to
carefully present their work in a clear and accessible fashion.
