SciPy 2015, the fourteenth annual Scientific Computing with Python
conference, was held July 6 |--| 12th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a
community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through
open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

The SciPy conferences have become a prominent forum for Python users
from the academic, commercial and government sectors to present and
develop their latest tools and innovations.  Topics cover a wide array
of domains, from cross-language interactions to education and
cutting-edge research. These events, by virtue of embracing both
in-depth scientific exploration and programming, form a unique
connection between the academic and developer communities. At SciPy,
code, science, and math live on the same screen.

It is an exciting time to be part of this community that has spent the
last decade developing sophisticated tools |---| tools that are now ideally
suited to address technical problems arising at the blooming
intersection of specialized domains and computation. Many contributors
to the community have been hired at university data institutions,
Python has become the number one language for undergraduate teaching,
and many productive partnerships have been formed with industry.

The conference continues to grow with almost 500 participants from
across the globe. More than half of attendees are now from industry,
the rest split between government laboratories and the academy.  The
organizing committee is committed to increasing representation from
underrepresented groups.  This year, sponsors awarded funding to help
31 people attend the conference.

Python for Data Science, Quantitative Finance, and Computational Social
Sciences were central themes this year, with additional minisymposia in domains
where the use of Python is strong or growing:

- Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Geospatial Information Sciences
- Geophysics
- Oceanography and Meteorology
- Computational Life and Medical Sciences
- Vision, Visualization, and Imaging
- Engineering

|noindent|
Birds of a Feather sessions were organized around various
topics, providing an effective platform for discussing issues relevant
to the community.  New open space activities, sponsor-funded social
events and tutorials effectively exposed newcomers to the welcoming
and inclusive scientific Python community.

We were privileged to have three prominent community members present
keynotes. Chris Wiggins gave a unique perspective on the data science
behind the New York Times, Wes McKinney told his story of a career
path through mathematics, finance and tech startups, and Jake
Vanderplas gave a motivating perspective on the interface between
science and data.

These proceedings contain **TODO:NPapers** peer-reviewed contributions, based on
talks presented at the conference.  They provide a peek into the
current state of the ever-evolving landscape of Python in Science.  We
hope you find pleasure in the effort the authors have made to
carefully present their work in a clear and accessible fashion.
