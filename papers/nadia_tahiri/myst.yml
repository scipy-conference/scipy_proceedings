  title: 'aPhyloGeo-Covid: A Web Interface for Reproducible Phylogeographic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variation using Neo4j and Snakemake'
  description: The gene sequencing data, along with the associated lineage tracing and research data generated throughout the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, constitute invaluable resources that profoundly empower phylogeography research. To optimize the utilization of these resources, we have developed an interactive analysis platform called aPhyloGeo-Covid.
