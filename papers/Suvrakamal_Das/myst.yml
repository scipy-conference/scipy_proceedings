  title: Mamba Models a possible replacement for Transformers?
  subtitle: A Memory-Efficient Approach for Scientific Computing
  description: The quest for more efficient and faster deep learning models has led to the development of various alternatives to Transformers, one of which is the Mamba model. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison between Mamba models and Transformers, focusing on their architectural differences, performance metrics, and underlying mechanisms.
