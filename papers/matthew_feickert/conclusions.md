## Conclusions

When the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012, the idea of being able to perform real Pythonic data analysis in HEP, let alone _efficient_ analysis, was viewed as unfeasible.
Though investment in the broader Scientific Python ecosystem, and development of the domain specific pieces in the Scikit-HEP organization the field of particle physics successfully created a PyHEP ecosystem of robust tooling.
Further investment by the ATLAS collaboration has resulted in new performant tooling for complex systematic corrections that will allow for more full and complex operations to be performed entirely within a Python workflow, helping to further reduce the time to insight for physics analysts.
