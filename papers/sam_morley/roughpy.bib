    abstract = "We present an open-source, pip installable toolkit, Sig-Networks, the first of its kind for longitudinal language modelling. A central focus is the incorporation of Signature-based Neural Network models, which have recently shown success in temporal tasks. We apply and extend published research providing a full suite of signature-based models. Their components can be used as PyTorch building blocks in future architectures. Sig-Networks enables task-agnostic dataset plug-in, seamless preprocessing for sequential data, parameter flexibility, automated tuning across a range of models. We examine signature networks under three different NLP tasks of varying temporal granularity: counselling conversations, rumour stance switch and mood changes in social media threads, showing SOTA performance in all three, and provide guidance for future tasks. We release the Toolkit as a PyTorch package with an introductory video, Git repositories for preprocessing and modelling including sample notebooks on the modeled NLP tasks.",

@article{Lyons1998,
abstract = {This paper aims to provide a systematic approach to the treatment of differential equations of the typedyt = Σi fi(yt) dxti where the driving signal xt is a rough path. Such equations are very common and occur particularly frequently in probability where the driving signal might be a vector valued Brownian motion, semi-martingale or similar process.However, our approach is deterministic, is totally independent of probability and permits much rougher paths than the Brownian paths usually discussed. The results here are strong enough to treat the main probabilistic examples and significantly widen the class of stochastic processes which can be used to drive stochastic differential equations. (For a simple example see [10], [1]).We hope our results will have an influence on infinite dimensional analysis on path spaces, loop groups, etc. as well as in more applied situations. Variable step size algorithms for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations [8] have been constructed as a consequence of these results.},
