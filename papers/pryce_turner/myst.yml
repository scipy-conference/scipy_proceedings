  title: Orchestrating Bioinformatics Workflows Across a Heterogeneous Toolset with Flyte
  description: While Python excels at prototyping and iterating quickly, itâ€™s not always performant enough for whole-genome scale data processing. Flyte, an open-source Python-based workflow orchestrator, presents an excellent way to tie together the myriad tools required to run bioinformatics workflows.
