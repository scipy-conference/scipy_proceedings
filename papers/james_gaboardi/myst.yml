  title: 'Spatial Microsimulation and Activity Allocation in Python: An Update on the Likeness Toolkit'
  description: Understanding human security and social equity issues within human systems requires large-scale models of population dynamics that simulate high-fidelity representations of individuals and access to essential activities (work/school, social, errands, health). Likeness is a Python toolkit that provides spatial microsimulation project.
