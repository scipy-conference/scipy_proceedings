BCE: Berkeley's Common Scientific Compute Environment for Research and Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

  Virtual machines are widely used, but in an ad hoc manner. Members of the UC
  Berkeley D-Lab, Statistical Computing Facility (SCF), and Berkeley Research
  Computing (BRC) have engaged in a thorough evaluation of virtualization
  technologies before arriving at a solution that we feel stands to become a
  broadly useful strategy for constructing the Berkeley Common Environment
  [BCE]_. We also provide a comparison with a successful, existing project,
  [OSGeo]_.

.. class:: keywords

   education, reproducibility, virtualization

Introduction
------------

Here we frame the problem space and describe the general class of devops
solutions.

Available Tools
---------------

"Collaboratool" was conceived as a project for building, integrating, and
deploying tools that support portable, reproducible data science.  We started
thinking about how to deploy virtualized containers that provide things like
IPython notebooks through the web. We were very inspired by
[jiffylab](http://github.com/ptone/jiffylab). From there, we decided that it
made more sense to focus on a complete virtual environment, which is easy to
deploy in a variety of contexts, which is what you'll find here now.

*DevOps*

XXX - Particularly need help from Aaron here

Lightweight virturalization (/ containerization) includes Docker / LXC / VMWare
ESX.

OSGeo: A Successful Common Environment
--------------------------------------

OSGeo is an example of a collaborative distribution that has managed to achieve
a consensus process for XXX geospatial projects. OSGeo is designed to be useable
as a virtual machine. This was started 7-8 years ago. Success only occured after
a few years of "tepid" progress. Part of the driver is likely the limited amount
of funds who are doing geospatial fieldwork. These people need to be able to go
out and be very efficient in the field. They also often lack advanced
programming / administration skills.

About 5 years ago, some funding came in for one of the contributors to document
all of this. Included hiring a graphic designer to make intro and tutorial pages
to introduce the templates for creating a package. This takes money (as compared
to the tech stuff).

OSGeo provides a place for a variety of projects to interoperate, and
potentially share with each other / synergy. OSGeo raises awareness of other
projects.

Founded on Ubuntu Linux, invite mature, stable projects. Overlap in language
group (C-based vs. JVM-based) and interest area. Code is visible, licenses are
established.

What are the steps that established credibility to get projects contributing to
the distribution. Initially, just shell scripts to install five core / important
packages (XXX - what were they and why?). Reached out to 50 projects, more
outside of U.S. than in, including many non-english (as a primary language),
esp. from Europe. The social component of building the community was not
necessarily explicit or even shared or known to all contributors (provable?).

It consists of a choice of basic tools that are widely known to free software
developers: shell, Perl, or Python. Scripts may call package managers, few
constraints (e.g., keep recipes contained to a particular directory). Core,
customizable scripts designed to bootstrap new recipes.

Particular example: web, including apache, WSGI, etc. Standard layout of web
directory. Fully working examples available for each "kind" of project.

The result is that certain tools are becoming more and more visible. Projects
are encouraged that are implemented in standard frameworks (i.e., not Forth).

There's still not complete consensus, but the project is moving towards some
consensus infrastructure. Also see the transfer of, e.g., military technology to
environmental applications.

Maybe include story about Jamaica response with open source mapping.

Major step in diffusion is folks knowing what the thing is at all. Value add /
branding - OSGeo has credibility from foundation status, participants,
consistent / good graphic design.

BCE: The Berkeley Common Environment
------------------------------------

The goal for the BCE is to provide both the ready-made environments, and also
the "recipes" or scripts setting up these environments. It should be easy for a
competent linux user to create recipes for custom tools that might not be
braodly useful (and thus, not already in BCE).

For classwork and research in the sciences at Berkeley, broadly defined to
include social science, life science, physical science, and engineering. Using
these tools, users can start up a virtual machine (VM) with a standardized Linux
operating environment containing a set of standard software for scientific
computing. The user can start the VM on their laptop, on a university server, or
in the cloud. Furthermore, users will be able to modify the instructions for
producing or modifying the virtual machine in a reproducible way for
communication with and distribution to others.

We envision the following core use cases:

  - creating a common computing environment for a course or workshop,
  - creating a common computational environment to be shared by a group of
    researchers or students, and
  - disseminating the computational environment so outsiders can reproduce the
    results of a group.

Other use cases/benefits:

 - Thin client / staff computing
 - Exam environments
 - Instructional labs
 - Sharing licensed software?
 - Make it easy to do the "right" thing (hard to do "wrong" thing)
 - Stable infrastructure
 - Managing complexity
 - Impacts beyond "the course"

What problems does BCE solve for you?

 - No more obscure installation issues - download and run a single virtual
   machine or get the same environment on a bare metal or virtual server.
 - I'm teaching a class - when you tell a student that a program behaves a
   certain way, it does!
 - I'm collaborating on some scientific research - now all of your collaborators
   can run your code without complex installation instructions.
 - Easy Deployment
 - Replication / Reproducible research
 - Easy transition across scales (laptop to cluster)
 - Tricky installs

To accomplish this, we envision that BCE will encompass the following:

 - a reproducible workflow that creates the standard VM/image
   with standard scientific computing software such as Python, R, git, etc.,
 - a standard binary image, produced by the workflow, that can be distributed as is and
   used on-the-fly with VirtualBox or VMWare Player with minimal dependencies, and
 - (possibly) an augmented workflow that represents multiple possible distributions tailored
   for different types of uses (e.g., different disciplines, different
   computational needs, class vs. research use, etc.). This might
   represent either a sequence or a tree of possible VMs.


*Tentative list of features*

 - VMs

   - A fixed, versioned VM provided each semester as a binary image for classes
     and workshops
   - Ideally, the same VM usable for research, with functionality for parallel
     computing and provisioned such that it can be used as the VM for virtual
     cluster nodes
   - The VM runnable on user laptops (Mac/Windows/Linux) and on cloud machines
   - The VM usable on user machines with minimal dependencies (e.g., either
     VirtualBox or VMware) and minimal setup, and with clear instructions for
     users on setup and on getting data/files into and out of the VM
   - Agreement on minimal hardware requirements on the host machine - do we
     support 32 bit, any minimum RAM required?
   - Shared folders (EBS on AWS), or other tech to make it possible to separate
     data from VM.

 - Provisioning

   - Provisioning is fully scripted - if the appropriate software is installed,
     the recipe should run reliably.
   - The provisioning details used to create a given VM available to users and
     with clear instructions on how to use and modify the provisioning; ideally
     the provisioning would be relatively simple for users to understand
   - The ability for a user to add software to a VM and then 'export' that
     information back into the provisioning workflow that can be used to
     recreate the modified VM

 - Logistics and training

   - A GitHub repository or the like plus a project website with all BCE
     materials available
   - Communication with users on bugs, desired features, and the like via the
     repository and a mailing list
   - Management / Versioning / Snapshotting

 - Problems

   - VMs reserve compute resources exclusively (less of a problem with LXC-like
     solutions).
   - Testing / Issue tracking

*Students ("horizontal" collaboration), Researchers ("vertical" collaboration)*

If you'd like to use the VM as a student, researcher, or instructor, our goal is
to make this easy for you.

If you're using VirtualBox, [follow these instructions](using-virtualbox.html).

If you'd like to use the VM on Amazon's EC2 cloud platform, [follow these
instructions](using-ec2.html).

Adding modules?

*Creating (and modifying) the BCE VM*

All the files for creating the VM are in the collaboratool repository on GitHub.

To clone the repository from the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool

Then go to the provisioning directory and see the information in HOWTO.md.

*VirtualBox*

  * Download and install VirtualBox from the [VirtualBox
    website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). This is the tool the
    runs the virtual machine for you. 
  * Download the BCE VM in the form of an OVA file from [UNDER
    CONSTRUCTION](BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova).
  * Open VirtualBox and import the BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova file you just
    downloaded by going to "File->Import Appliance" and then selecting the .ova
    file from wherever you downloaded it to (possible 'Downloads' in your home
    directory on the machine). 
  * Wait a few minutes...
  * Start the virtual machine by clicking on the tab for "BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64" on the left side and then clicking "Start" at the top. This will start a virtual Linux computer within your own machine. After a few seconds you should see black screen and then soon you'll see the desktop of the VM.

You now have a machine that has all the software installed as part of BCE, including IPython and useful Python packages and R, RStudio and useful R packages.

You can get a terminal window that allows you to type commands in a UNIX-style shell by clicking on the icon of the black box with the $ symbo on the top panel. Using this you can start IPython Notebook by simply typing "ipython notebook" or  R by simply typing 'R' at the prompt in the terminal. This starts a bare-bones R session. To start RStudio, either type 'rstudio' at the prompt on go to "Applications->Programming->RStudio".

You can restart the VM at any time by opening VirtualBox and clicking on the tab for the VM and clicking "Start" as you did above.

*Sharing folders and copying files between your computer and the VM*

One useful thing will be to share folders between the VM and the host machine so that you can access the files on your computer from the VM. Do the following:

  * Got to "Devices->Shared Folder Settings" and click on the icon of a folder
    with a "+" on the right side.
  * Select a folder to share, e.g. your home directory on your computer by
    clicking on "Folder Path" and choosing "Other" and navigating to the folder
    of interest. For our purposes here, assume we click on "Documents".
  * Click "make permanent" and "auto-mount" and then click "Ok".
  * Reboot the machine by going to applications button on the left of the top
    toolbart, clicking on "Log Out", and choosing "Restart" in the window that
    pops up.
  * Once the VM is running again, click on the "Shared" folder on the desktop.
    You should see the folder "sf_Documents" (or whatever the folder name you
    selected was, in place of 'Documents'). You can drag and drop files to
    manipulate them.
  * Alternatively, from the Terminal, you can also see the directory by doing
    "cd ~/Desktop/shared/sf_Documents" and then "ls" will show you the files. 

Be careful: unless you selected "read only" at the same time as "make
permanent", any changes to the shared folder on the VM affects the folder in the
'real world', namely your computer. 

*EC2*

  - Go to [EC2 management console](http://console.aws.amazon.com) and choose the US-West-2 (Oregon) region, as that is where we have posted the BCE AMI. (You'll need to have an account set up.)
  - On the "AMIs" tab, search for the BCE AMI amongst public images.
  - Launch an instance
  - Follow the instructions given in the "Connect" button to SSH to the instance
  - If you want to connect as the "oski" user, you can deposit your public SSH key in the .ssh folder of the "oski" user.


Examples for proper rst formatting
----------------------------------

Code highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }

Important Part
--------------

It is well known [Atr03]_ that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots


The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+


Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse:

  *Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.*
